Therefore the use of AI to create things they can pass off as their own will only increase exponentially, *especially* given the mindless way it's being co-opted into nearly every single goddamn thing in the online and creative worlds.   The quality of everything being produced will obviously degrade dramatically over time, but hey - entire generations have now been successfully conditioned to consume any old *slop* without any real objective critique.

https://i.redd.it/tcfz8ha5laqd1.jpeg,lod1uo1,PooSham,"If you have to pre rinse you're probably doing something wrong. Here are some tips:   1. Clean the filters and lose parts inside the machine 2. Put some detergent into the pre wash dispenser. If there isn't any such dispenser, put some directly into the machine. Powder is the best, but don't forget to fill salt and rinse aid from time to time if you use powder.  3. if it's connected to the hot water tubes (common in the US), it might be a good idea to let the water run for a while before turning the machine on.  Check out [this video](https://youtu.be/jHP942Livy0?si=IXfg0xyksjM6PEK5) that explains how dish washers work and why these tips might help.   But of course you're right, all of this extra job makes it worse than AI. My dream is to have at least two dish washers so that I never have to unload them, I'll just use them as cupboards.",2,2024-09-22 13:56:29,https://i.redd.it/tcfz8ha5laqd1.jpeg#comment-lod1uo1

https://i.redd.it/tcfz8ha5laqd1.jpeg,lohcaua,lrdmelchett,"There's is truth in that.  I'm not sure to what extent.  Also, if LLM ""AI"" is based on what is already known, and capitalism thrives on new ideas and frontiers - it would seem illogical that the system could thrive without human capriciousness and ingenuity.  Edit:  Humans do weird things.  Sometimes wonderfully weird things and capitalism can leverage that    because humans like these strangely wonderful things that are clearly the result of unencumbered human thought.  I'm not sure LLM ""AI"" can truly pull off this kind of phenomenon.  And, I'm not sure if humans would appreciate and invest in such things organic in nature being formulated by an entity that does not think.  An interesting tangent to this line of thought is to consider Elon Musk's comments on defending being a ""speciesist"" while Larry Page essentially considers the next important evolution of all that we are is to create a ""digital god.""

It’s not perfect by any means, and I rarely use whatever it spits out without heavy editing, but it does help.  For example, I once had it write out a complicated string transformation function, and it worked well. I wrote a robust set of tests for the function, ran ChatGPT’s code through the test, saw the places where it failed, and then I politely asked it to fix those issues until it started passing all the tests.  I mostly did that because it wasn’t my main focus for the ticket I was working on, but it was strictly necessary to implement. I bet it would have taken me a couple hours to get it exactly right and make it efficient, but this task took me less than 45 minutes with the help of AI. And I read through all of it to make sure I understood what it was doing, which is something I strongly recommend doing with any AI-generated code.",1,2024-11-11 17:25:20,https://i.redd.it/6wwb8qg6260e1.jpeg#comment-lwly0j7

You could also think of it this way - what on earth are you going to do to make a Todo implementation impressive? Develop a novel way to CRUD? A fancy UI? Unless you're some sort of savant you're probably reinventing the wheel. It is an exercise of diminishing returns.  If you were a car mechanic and you turned up for an interview proclaiming you spent the last six months developing novel ways to change oil it might be mildly interesting. However the guy who spent the last six months familiarising himself with the ODB codes for the cars you most commonly fix is going to be a lot more attractive, even thought he changes oil the ol' regular way.  Here's my advice. You want to work somewhere? Contact their HR and ask them what technical projects would impress them in an interview for the role you want (whether they are hiring or not). HR people love this shit and often need something to do. Then go and do it.

But there are projects that are highly technical like compilers. And they will care about such projects.   As a recruiter they aren't searching for programmers with business ideas. They have other people for that. They are looking for a programmer who can write best code for the purpose they asked for.   Imagine you are a recruiter for programmers and in one hand you have a person who wrote a program which solves a real life problem with a ChatGpt wrapper and another wrote a compiler. Who would you hire?   A programmer should be a problem solver but the problem should be in code not in business ideas. And as a programmer you have almost 0 input for other things other than code.    And you need more knowledge and hard work to build such challenging things. It would be a cup of tea for a person who implemented a kernel to build a inventory application.  https://x.com/mxcl/status/608682016205344768,1,2024-09-11 23:00:57,https://i.redd.it/ix9ykzkbdqnd1.jpeg#comment-lmok4mk

https://i.redd.it/ix9ykzkbdqnd1.jpeg,lmq4lfl,N/A,This is a valid reasoning but no one will have a compiler or a kernel as their first or only projects. There will be other projects like a desktop application or a simple game.   Just think why do companies ask how to invert a binary tree. It's to test their programming ability not to judge our requirements vs your knowledge. It is likely that you won't invert a binary tree ever. (I am not saying DSA is useless it is powerful.).   Such hard projects demonstrates how good you are at programming as a whole not to show I am good at this language/framework/technology.   Such hard projects are of different breeds and are treated as such. A toy kernel challenges you in so many ways that with a website it might not be possible.   I recommend you to read at least the first 50 pages of: Engineering a Compiler Book by Keith D. Cooper and Linda Torczon  I have completed this book but I recommend you to read at least 50 pages even if you are not interested in compiler design. You will understand why it is regarded so highly. About kernels I don't know much other than they are harder to build.,1,2024-09-12 05:47:55,https://i.redd.it/ix9ykzkbdqnd1.jpeg#comment-lmq4lfl

What you're refering to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.  Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.  There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called Linux distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux!",0,2024-10-27 01:02:05,https://v.redd.it/e98l8p1uvuwd1#comment-ltxuwb2

Just a spider web of private methods that each exist to modify one private field and then call one other private method which modifies a different field. Just the fucking nightmare and a half to track.  There are a few good examples, like his ""naming"" example with Minesweeper, but that is a small piece of code. Whenever he shows anything at scale it becomes a yikes.

I remember messing with some early versions of GPT (before ChatGPT or the wave of popularity that came after). I just asked it to remember a few characters, and was really impressed when a few messages later it remembered a few things about them. I had no concept what it might be useful for, but was pretty impressed by the fact that simple pattern recognition could result in anything so coherent. I didn’t know exactly what it was going to be useful for, but it seemed like a technology engineers were surely going to find very interesting uses for.   After GPT3 and the crazy hype that followed, the tech-demos got more and more sophisticated and the “this is surely something we can make into a useful technology” feeling didn’t go away… but the “world-changing breakthrough” hype train took off way ahead of it. I still don’t know what AI is ultimately going to be most useful for. I still think it’s going to be pretty useful for some things. But all of that is being occluded by the polarizing culture around it. We need to chill and start focusing on implementing reliable autocomplete or data structure transformation tools or something instead of trying to forecast when scientists will become obsolete to hyper-intelligent machines.  AI as a real, new capability available for engineers to make into things is not a farce. But AI being presented as paradigm-shift beyond our imagination is a huge sleight-of-hand. And the fact that people are catching onto that is also resulting in those looking into tangible implementations being grouped into one extreme or the other.   Don’t believe the promises or the condemnations. AI is a really efficient way to do pattern recognition over sets of data so large it would’ve been computationally impossible before. That’s not nothing, but the fact is we don’t really understand what to do with that right now. What you’re hearing is mostly people’s fantasies of what that might turn into.",3,2024-10-30 00:28:28,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/linus-torvalds-reckons-ai-is-90-percent-marketing-and-10-percent-reality#comment-lufyzjk

I'm an expert developer with decades of experience. These days with AI (mainly Claude API, also o1-preview API), I can create tools on the spot to solve little problems that would have taken me hours or days otherwise. I'm at least 10 times more productive and it's steadily increasing as I improve my toolkit.  People saying AI is only good for simple things don't understand that all good code is simple and modular, ideal for AI processing in even a small context window.   AI code quality when prompted correctly is much better than my normal code quality. AI is incredibly helpful for every aspect of software development and for life in general. Enjoy this time, while human effort is still relevant also. AI helps me with brainstorming ideas, planning, initial coding, writing tests, fixing bugs, applying changes, refactoring, comments and documentation, research and summarisation, dictation, etc. I use AI almost continually while working, at very little cost. I feel more like a technical manager than a programmer much of the time, although I still do get down and dirty in the code too.  An example, the other day with AI help I wrote a program to convert mp4 files to streaming format with the moov atom at the front, in place, without rewriting the whole file, on Linux. Admittedly this took quite an effort, but the AI was very helpful and I would not have tackled this project on a whim if I didn't have AI assistance. I had no significant prior knowledge of mp4 format or how to use Linux fallocate, and my C was pretty rusty.   I don't know whether anyone has actually done this before, at least I don't see any open source tool to do it, and it's something that could potentially be very useful for video streaming companies. It would cost you thousands of dollars to hire an expert developer to make this without using AI, but it took me just a few hours with AI. I'm confident that current LLMs could develop this autonomously with little or no human help, if set up correctly.",3,2024-10-29 10:01:20,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/linus-torvalds-reckons-ai-is-90-percent-marketing-and-10-percent-reality#comment-lubp7ia

You're due for a very rude wakeup call soon.   My workflow is this:  I spend 5 or 10 minutes writing up a detailed description of what the AI (built on top of LLMs) should do.   Get up and go for a walk. Come back half an hour later.   The code is written, comprehensive unit tests are written, ran, bugs fixed. It has run through end to end test to make sure everything works. Code is committed to git.   I review the code. Run the tests myself. It misunderstood one part of it. So I tell it to fix it. It makes the fix, updates the unit tests, runs the code, commits the code, reports back.   I review the code again. Run it. All good. Rinse and repeat.  The app its working on? And as advanced AI coding agent built on top of LLMs. Not exactly a crud app.   Today I have a demo with my first client - a financial services company that processes complex and very messy financial data for large retailers.  Obviously my reality is so different from your world view that you are going to call bullshit on this. But here's the deal. You can try out the basic concept yourself, right now.   Go tell ChatGPT or Claude to write some code, something complex but modular and testable. Copy and paste your code locally. Build it. If there are build errors, paste them back into ChatGPT. It'll tell you how to fix the code. Rinse and repeat until it builds. Now tell it to write tests. Copy/paste/build/fix. Then run the tests. Give ChatGPT the results if they didn't succeed. It'll tell you how to fix it. Then go through that loop with it until the code is fixed. Then tell it to evaluate what gaps there are in the tests. Iterate with it. Then run the code and give it the output. Iterate.   That's hugely painful to do on your own, but you can easily see how it can be automated.   Now build in workflows to manage all kinds of shit like managing context window and output limits, letting the AI selectively choose which files are relevant, keeping good documentation, etc etc, etc.   You're going to shit yourself when you realize how ridiculously wrong you are about the current state of AI in software development.   Like I said in my example, it's not perfect. But it's about the equivalent of a mid-level software engineer (who codes 100x faster than any human).

It (very genuinely) freaked me out at first too.   I obviously can't predict the future, but I think the industry as a whole is headed exactly towards what I'm doing. So here's my early take.   This will be capable of replacing the bottom half of devs within the next month or two, but short term (a couple of years) it will drive innovation much more than it drives layoffs - and even that will be a slow ramp-up (like it'll take at the very least a year to reach 25% adoption of this kind of tech for small and medium sized companies). Point is, you've got a couple of years before you can't find a job as a below average developer.   It will devastate cheap offshore labor - the cheap offshore teams will be entirely gone in the next 18 months. They are easy to replace and this is literally already better than hiring an offshore team in all ways.  There will be a hugely increased demand for product people. If you're a mediocre dev but enjoy working in tech, start polishing your product skills. Product managers with a dev background are going to be *highly* in demand. You've also got a good opportunity in QA. If you're a software architect, you're good - it seems unlikely for you to be replaced by AI in the next 5 years. If you're barely scraping by as a dev, read the writing on the wall.

But since I'm doing this on my own, I spend half an hour designing the feature, kick off the AI, iterate a couple of times, and have it fully complete within an hour of when I started designing it. When normally it would have taken a day or two.   I'm not building entire apps in half an hour. But I am doing now in a day or two what would have normally taken a month. And it's not ""press a button, presto"". I'm breaking out a huge feature into a bunch of small chunks - chunks you would give to a human developer that would take them a few days to do, with specifications to the level of detail you would give you a (fairly dense) human developer. And sometimes the AI just entirely fucks it up. So I just kill the entire PR it made, fix the ticket (or ""prompt"") and kick it back off - whatever, it ran for 10 minutes. And for the extra complicated bits I don't think the AI will wire up properly, I write those myself.   I would say I spend 25% of my day writing tickets, 25% of my day reviewing code the AI wrote, and half my day writing code. And it's easily 10x faster for the same high quality. But it's all still carefully planned, carefully executed software development. It's not magic. Randi with an idea can't just tell AI to make it be so.   Also, worth mentioning that my client won't have the same 10x. I can get that because I've designed my code to be modular and easy to work on my AI. The product I'm selling lets them take care of all the easy ish backlog tickets that are drudgery for a dev. Positioning it as 25% bump in productivity for the team as a whole, and I think that's realistic and exciting for a slow moving monstrosity.   I guess my point is that a 10x increase is huge. But it's a chainsaw over an axe. It doesn't turn a live tree into cut and dried lumber instantly. Modern IDEs are an axe. Tools like Cursor are chainsaws. I'm building a (flickering) lightsaber. It's crazy to me that people think chainsaws are just hype because finished lumber doesn't fall to the ground, and think that's the next evolution.",1,2024-10-31 19:12:59,https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/linus-torvalds-reckons-ai-is-90-percent-marketing-and-10-percent-reality#comment-luqr5n8

That's not where I'm personally seeing productivity gains.   I don't trust the output, and I design the data flow. I give it the recent API references for context. I ask for specific functions, and it spits out small chunks that I string together by my own logic. It maintains the context of that design and it's outputs, and can suggest enhancements. I still have to tweak things, and it's not right 100% of the time, but 80-95% of the way there with proper syntax while having constant iterative feedback saves enormous amounts of time in the prototyping process, then it's refined.   I sure hope noone is expecting to tell an LLM, ""I need an app for that,"" and it just spits out production ready applications. That would be insane.

I love coding. In fact, it's still really easy for me to fall into the trap of ""I'll just write this myself real quick"" and waste a bunch of time. My previous ""real"" job was as a CTO. I always made time to code to keep myself grounded. I hated days where I was in meetings all day.   All of that to just say, I respect you and feel you. But it doesn't change the fact that AI is coming for your job and you need to mix things up now to keep your job long term.   On to your questions!  >how is the experience like working with AI?  There are 3 levels. I do all three. First is AI built into your IDE. Cursor is the best I've used, GitHub copilot is ok. There is ""auto complete"" as well as ""chat"" for both systems - make sure you use both.   2nd level is just telling a Chatbot (ChatGPT/Claude) to write up code for you.   3rd level is managing the process from a higher level and having an agent write code.   I start with the 3rd level and have the agent write fairly isolated components of the system. For extra tricky bits I want to have more control of, I'll let Claude take a stab at it. Then I'll stitch it all together with code I write with the help of Cursor.   >How do you know it's accurate?  Same way you know the code you write is accurate. Read the code, then run the code. See if it works. If it's extra complex, I'll have the AI write a bunch of tests for the code and run those. If you get any errors, you can literally just copy and paste the error to the AI and it will fix the mistake.   Sometimes it really fucks stuff up and can't fix it's open mistake. But that's ok, just start over and edit your prompt to be more clear.  >Do you need to learn new technologies or just use whatever the AI suggests?  You tell the AI to use whatever language or framework you want. ""Write a hello world program in VB.net""  The thing that you do need to learn, though, is just what the AI is good at and what it isn't. I can give you a vague idea, but I can't explain the nuances. The best thing to do is just try everything through AI first. See what it does. If it's trash, try a few different ways to prompt it. If it's still trash maybe the task you gave it was too big or complex. It's going to be slower at first as you learn. But that's ok, it's an investment in your future.   >what's your contribution in all of that?  My agent is really smart and can do things others can't, like seamlessly navigate huge code bases to complete a task that requires edits to multiple files. But the same fundamental principles apply. If you give it vague instructions, it won't do s good job. If you tell it to do ABC and you meant for it to do XYZ, it's probably not going to do what you wanted. It's all about understanding what kinds of things make the AI work better and what makes it worse.   Genuinely, good luck.

You are adding or modifying text. The primary benefit of VIM and vim motions is that you are able to navigate text content significantly faster.   Just a tip - if you are a complete novice in something, don’t make broad proclamations like “I don’t believe you can navigate HTML faster”. You have no clue what you are talking about, and it makes you look really stupid when you are claiming that I’m untruthful about being able to navigate a text file faster in VIM because that’s the core benefit of learning VIM/VIM motions. Your comment below about clicking the minimap is way faster just demonstrates how little you know about what you are talking about and should likely keep your uninformed opinions to yourself.",4,2024-11-15 00:37:49,https://i.redd.it/fwe491o91v0e1.jpeg#comment-lx6ijkt

If it's not worthwhile, they can start accounting for the time this process is taking and decide based on costs, and it will bee axed if you are right.

If you want to be able to change things quickly and reliably avoid regressions and other bugs, we have to go back and pay off that tech debt.”  But if they respond with refusing to put that time in, it’s just a high-level decision they’ve made that they don’t need that flexibility to be financially successful, and the long time it will take to make any meaningful changes is a cost they’re willing to accept in exchange for having been first to market with their initial feature set.

Not using AI again after having used it for a while changes the process, and you notice the change.  Without AI, it’s more work (?) but the output is clean in a way that AI generated code is not. The difference is subtle, but it’s there.  The manual process is subjectively more rewarding for sure. More joy in the process == a better end result. I can’t prove that, but I believe it to be true.  Given that AI is a prediction engine.. the output is “towards the mean”, so it’s always going to be boilerplatey and “average” by definition.  The proof in the pudding is the measurable increase in tech debt and dependency baggage that an AI output has vs a purely manual approach.

And writing code with LLM you still have the same old syntax and all. The LLM is basically a better google with better auto completion and an IDE plugin. I don't see it as really changing how I am writing code. If it is not even integrated in the IDE, it really feel like a slightly better google.  To me if you see that as so different, it is because you didn't embrace searching online to code before. The big difference was that before internet, you used a book, you had to remember things and most of the stuff you had to figure out yourself.  But the last 20 years already I could get any common algorithm, any common computer science problem really, get an instant response from google and then take 30s to 5 minutes to select the right one and then incorporate it into my software (the longest part).  LLM make it better, no doubt but this is mostly more of the same, really.  On top, if you are most mastering what you do and don't have enough experience, LLM can give you lot of almost right code that you will struggle to make work for you for hours. It doesn't replace the coder, it is really a much improved assistant, but you still need to put in the effort, understand the subtleties and all.  And like a newcomer with google could not come with the right google query to save his life to get the right code, the newcomer can't get the LLM to give what they need to save their life.",1,2024-12-25 00:00:38,https://i.redd.it/0o75x8lq8z7e1.jpeg#comment-m3o2u32

It's why Linux dominates the server world despite never charging a penny for the software.

Additionally you should be mentoring those around you, and accept new ideas, this is the trend of our field.  Furthermore, if you're juggling mission critical regexes, you should probably just be substringing it at this point. I have a rule of thumb that if it's mission critical I will manually write the string comprehension out.  I've wrote language parsers like this and it's taken me eons.

The point has been that LLMs can be a great tool, but you can get into big trouble if you don't actually understand the underlying fundamentals of what you're generating, and you can get complacent by over-utilizing tools like LLMs, or calculators.

https://i.redd.it/4hzzco99wrsd1.png,lqhuv5f,DataBreach96,"I got the Glove80 because I could feel that RSI is going to become an issue. Portability and switching to different devices is important to me - something the Kinesis is not appropriate for.  I used my normal Keychron for work and Glove80 at home for leisure and learning. Within 3 days I was typing as fast on the Glove 80 and had become incredibly comfortable with it. So, I then just started to work with the Glove80 - slightly uncomfortable for half a week and then it became beautifully comfortable.   However. now after having the Glove80 for 6 months the shortcomings Prime mentioned are coming to light.  The Keyboard moves when I’m working aggressively which means I am now readjusting the board 2-3 times a work session.   That said, the Glove80 has been a complete game-changer for me and all its shortcomings have easy fixes - but my great experience with the Glove80 gives me hope that the Master Forge from CharaChorder might be another huge leap forward for me.  TL;DR Used the Glove at home for a week before taking it to work, then within 3/4 days it was working better than my normal keyboard.  Use the MoErgo Discord, when it comes to their customers (as far as I’ve seen), they are amazing.",2,2024-10-05 18:35:49,https://i.redd.it/4hzzco99wrsd1.png#comment-lqhuv5f

There is nothing custom in the sense that I’ve changed the QWERTY layout. For example, some people have a custom symbols layout like [this one.](https://youtu.be/uuSR81wc6WQ?si=G4KMBHLTg5iJTqa-). My layout is completely normal, but the modifier keys are different - the difficult thing that Stephen solved for me was that he put in a macro where the layer automatically changed depending on which device I connect with.

https://i.redd.it/4hzzco99wrsd1.png,lqlo0ji,tehsilentwarrior,Ah. That’s awesome. Didn’t know you could do that.   I setup some weird mappings on mine to try and get it more optimized and easier to adopt to but then I end up forgetting about what they do.   Going from win to mac is also an issue for me. Thanks for the share btw. On a normal keyboard it’s not a big deal because I can just mentally switch the buttons but on the Glove the keys are way more optimized so having to use a different one becomes weird.   I noticed that I use shift way more and put that closer to my thumb on the left cluster. Did you do changes like this?,1,2024-10-06 11:33:32,https://i.redd.it/4hzzco99wrsd1.png#comment-lqlo0ji

But, on the cheaper end of the scale with pennies per millions of tokens, or self hosting stuff that fits in your vram especially if you have excess solar production... It is also a no brainer to have more assistant type automations to attempt different stuff automatically. Plenty of cool things to figure out in terms of UX in this space.  Lots of people try to argue the AI wastes their time because it isn't good enough. The issue is that the threshold for being good enough is a multidimensional jagged frontier of capabilities that you can also push forward yourself quite a bit by changing your own workflow. To me a strategy isn't sound until you take into account how that landscape evolves, rather than sampling it now and deciding it's shit.   One example, i have hammerspoon screenshot hotkeys for gpt4o. I already use it regularly in situations where I want to explain a structure to a text based LLM like o1 or pinch tokens and its a great way to ask for a transcription or description for anything you have on your screen. the tech still has a huge amount of untapped potential, even with the new chatgpt native macos app, the value locked behind even more streamlined ux is immense.",2,2024-10-06 23:04:23,https://i.redd.it/fw99wf45f7td1.jpeg#comment-lqoznqk

Most of us had to grind in school and also help at home, and a bad environment with no proper guidance. This is just one aspect of it.      The other aspect is that we just have a terrible work culture. Apart from everything being expensive and all in while getting paid in peanuts, long hours with no benefits at all. Why would anyone expect quality work in this case ? In fact I know alot of people in the industry that deliberately do low quality work or the bare minimum and learn for personal benefits just because they get paid less.   I know a guy who recently left who single handedly implemented/migrated to Splunk (SIEM) for a company. We all thought he was getting paid well but then he revealed before he left that he got paid just 20% more than us. It's an amalgamation of alot of problems that is affecting the lack of ambition. I'm still passionate about Security, i learn and upskill everyday, used to solve alot of problems for the company, but why should i put effort for a shitty pay in a poverty driven country when the company is doing good ? And for those who say quit, it's not easy to get another job even if you have good skills and it's the same work culture in like 90% of the industry.   We are operating at a different level than others and still you will find alot ambitious folks in the industry. But yes there are more shitty coders than good ones for sure.      One more point i want to highlight is that there alot of incompetent senior/principal engineers who get into that position by bootlicking or nepotism, often these are the ones that play powerplay and decide what code will be accepted.",4,2024-12-08 21:16:53,https://youtu.be/zKd_kxcxGbo?si=yaqdtOgFzaMnqnLK#comment-m13byv0

Are you talking about the state of things prior to when you started or when you started? Because if it’s the latter it feels like you’re trying to give off the impression that it was more dated than it actually was for the time.   For instance, I started programming around that time in 2008, and as someone that was self taught I can tell you that programming was very easily accessible back then. We had plenty of books, blogs, community forums (SO came onto the scene not too long later), and yes even youtube videos/channels dedicated to it. Likewise when it came to the technologies that were popular in the industry there was already a wide range that varied greatly in how much they abstracted the underlying details, to the point that it’s not even remotely true to suggest that all jobs required an understanding of the things you listed (memory management, deep OS knowledge, TCP/UDP, etc.). While bootcamps came later (early to mid 2010s IIRC), you could still enter the industry without a degree.   Btw I don’t mean to derail your message as I know this isn’t the point of your post.   On the topic of things getting easier, it’s both true and false. Certain things get commoditised which makes them more approachable. But at the same time other areas are continually built upon even further (and you can’t always just get away with understanding only the top level), which then adds to their complexity (this also tends to lead to increased specialisation).",0,2024-05-24 10:31:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1cz289k/theres_never_been_a_better_time_to_be_a/#comment-l5g9wjr

You pointed out many reasons why it's a great time to be a programmer.  With a little know how and help from your favorite AI assistant, you can write pretty much anything you want.  The barrier to entry is extremely low too (historically speaking).  It also doesn't *really* matter 99% of the time what you code something in.  You can write desktop apps in JAVA, or web apps in GO.  You can experiment with a bunch of different frameworks, and the possibilities are endless.  We're at a point where most people will run out of ideas on what to build before they run out of ways to build things.  >I think that in the coming years 'regular' programmers will be automated.

In fact, I support even stronger sanctions against my own country. When diverse groups of people are impacted by sanctions and understand that their government's actions are the root cause, the regime gradually loses support.

If you're reviewing someone's code to that level of detail, it's just easier to write the code yourself and save yourself the stress and time of dealing with people you consider untrustworthy.",1,2024-11-03 07:19:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1ggqlkv/long_term_linux_maintainer_banned_after/#comment-lv58zl6

But the logical and factual thing is that US is on the path do so .  My conspiracy theory might be too far fetched but what the og comment is not illogical , forking FOSS projects when the maintainers decide to alter the core principles has always been a good idea , and there are several equally or more skilled developers on this planet (thanks to the kernel being open source) who would love to fork and contribute towards it maintaining the core principles ,.

During the low-interest years from the 2008 Great Recession until 2022 the post-pandemic recovery, rivers of cheap and honestly pretty dumb money were flowing into software-based startup dot com outfits.  Why? Investment managers were looking for better returns that the 0.2% interest, or whatever, they could get for bonds.   Software people got nice pay and elevated social status. Lots of younger people saw that and said ""that's for me"". They hustled in high school and got into Cal Berkeley. They're the best and the brightest, many of them.  Then interest rates went up due to the Federal Reserve doing the John Maynard Keynes thing to suppress inflation. And the rivers of dumb investment money dried up. And along with them dried up the software jobs, especially for people fresh out of school. But for everybody. A bubble burst. Layoffs. We know the story. Elder devs have been through it in 1987, 2001, 2008, and now 2022. It's part of the game. (When neolib philosopher Francis Fukuyama pitched the ""end of history"" at the end of the 20th century, I wish I had some of whatever he was smoking.)  And, lo and behold, now people hiring software devs are getting hundreds of experienced applicants for every job. Capitalist economists say ""the job market can't clear because it's imbalanced"". The scramble for jobs in the imbalanced market is driving everybody crazy, candidates, recruiters, hiring managers, headhunters. Apparently even college professors who are rightly concerned about their students' career success are worried about this.  But college enrollments reflect incentives several years in the past.  It too will pass.   If you're in this software field, always always ask yourself: is somebody who actually uses my stuff paying me for it?

People graduate, start on their first jobs, and it’s fucking nothing like their college projects. How you do teamwork is different. How your work is evaluated is different. Expected deliverables are different.  Essentially, software engineering could be taught better at trade schools. And then you could enter academia to do hard science so you could develop a successor to transformers.  The whole situation that you graduated from the university to find a job where you do scrum and spend days centering some fucking buttons on screen for mad bucks is not normal, has never been normal. LLMs can fumble just the same for a fraction of price. (Except they don’t improve on their own, but that’s another story.)  The curriculum is always behind, and it was behind when I started in the field. We were taught Pascal on pirated Borland Pascal, and the jobs wanted PHP and HTML. I had to reorient very damn quickly. Now it’s behind because LLMs.  The cruel thing, though, is that you still need to understand and master whatever LLMs can do, and amass practice with it yourself before you can surpass them, and pay bills in the meantime. I don’t know how to solve this for average João who doesn’t have rich parents and maybe lives in Brazil.

I got four job offers. It might sound like a humble brag, but it’s not.  I started as a React Andy back in 2014. Never finished university. Worked my way into this career one step at a time.  For the first time ever, I was let go from a company. At first, I was absolutely gutted. I liked my job, and the thought of having to jump back into interviews made me dread the whole process. To top it off, my confidence was shot, and I had good reason to feel that way.  But life doesn’t pause. I had no choice but to find a job—quick. A 3-year-old kid at home, a stay-at-home wife, partial support going to my mum overseas, and, to add some spice, I was paying off £8k in debt from some past mistakes. The business gave us a redundancy notice, 30 days before layoffs were confirmed. That clock started ticking fast.  I recently heard a quote from Alex Hormozi, whose podcast and audiobook I’ve just started digging into: “Do enough work that it’s unreasonable for you to fail.”  That stuck with me.  If you’re putting in the work, even in the darkest moments, you’ll feel better about yourself.  The market is rough out there. October especially is apparently low season for hiring. Here’s how it went for me:  I applied to around 80 jobs. I got about 40 rejections within a week or two. Most of the others ghosted me or took weeks to reply. I had 10 interviews.  Two of those jobs were amazing opportunities. I completely bombed my second-to-last interviews for both. That was a kick to the gut. But I reminded myself—interviewing is just a skill. So I sought feedback, figured out where I went wrong, and tried to do better next time.  The last day I worked at my old company was the day I got my first offer. The second offer came the following week. Even though I’d verbally accepted the first, I decided to go through the second interview anyway. Turned out to be an even better offer.  I went down to decline the first offer in person—wanted to do it respectfully. Funny enough, while I was in town, I met up with someone for coffee, just a casual catch-up. Turns out, they were looking for contracting help.  That’s life sometimes. Doors you don’t even know exist can open when you least expect it.  Good luck, lads.  This was my recent experience, for whatever it’s worth. I hope it helps someone out there in a similar spot. Keep going. Things can turn around when you put in the effort.",1,2024-11-24 01:09:26,https://www.yourtango.com/sekf/berkeley-professor-says-even-outstanding-students-arent-getting-jobs#comment-lyo37h2

This was more of a Volcker thing than a Keynes thing. Please don't just throw words around. Keynes would have advocated for gov spending not monetary policy for the COVID scenario.   Volcker realized that wages were ""sticky"" or they were normally slow to change. So while we were having a ""wage spiral"" (where wage increases caused inflation which caused wage increases) he pumped rates even higher to make wage growth be unable to match and stop the spiral, deflating wages. We were in a minor wage spiral in 2021 and they repeated the stunt. But they temporarily bumped inflation up intentionally for this wage suppression.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a_Vz2ytVCQ,lzl4as0,MasterLJ,"It's usually not Big Tech where they go to hide, it's middling company's large IT orgs.  Big Tech companies are usually much better at weeding those people out (""usually"" being foreshadowing).  And the opposite of a 10xer is a -10xer.  Those also exist.  It's also not laziness, it's usually fraud.  Fake resumes.  Fake experience.  Professionals doing the interviews to send some random person to the job.  A recent anecdote (among many): I began work for a particular company and noticed there was an engineer who had done no work at all in the past years.   I did my due diligence to see what their contributions were.  They were clearly hiding.  I gave them a task to do, completely on their own time estimates.  I followed up for a few weeks (this was a dead-simple task, like 1/2 day of work) before finally receiving a PR.  It would not compile.   It was as if the rapture had happened mid line type, and this engineer gave me completely incomplete code as if I just didn't finish this sente....  I gently confront this person and they attempt to gaslight me, which was super odd, but I have seen this behavior in interviews as well from other fraudsters.  My favorite being when a coworker and I were interviewing a candidate who also had non-compiling code, but proclaimed ""there it is!"" when we hit the ""Run"" button and a slough of errors popped out without any output at all, let alone the output we asked for.  We continued to hit the ""Run"" button to the candidate's delight and their response was as if it was working, but clearly it was erroring.  Back to the original story, I didn't accept the PR (obviously), and was confident enough that this person was full of shit to campaign to have them looked at more closely by management, solicit others' input on their performance as well.  To the company's credit, they were finally let go after producing absolutely nothing in 2 years.  In fact, back to the -Xer comment, they produced less than 0.  They wasted time with their lies and their fraud.  Curiously, myself and the newly fired engineer remained connected on LinkedIn (I was honestly curious, but this person just wanted as many followers as possible).  They posted prolifically.  In one day they had posted a GitHub repo to all of their hard-earned LeetCode work they had done.  They had postured themselves as someone who could help you find a job, and were sharing how they were tackling the job search.  All 200+ problems and their solutions.  I navigate on over to the repo, and all of it was uploaded on the same day.  Much wow.  It was 100% bullshit.  Fast forward about a year and I am now working in Big Tech.  Guess who also got hired at the same company (shared on LinkedIn, obviously)?  Over the years I've looked at their PRs and found 2... exactly as the study describes, a simple config change, a one-liner etc.  I have no idea how they got hired into Big Tech but they only lasted about 2 years.  I'm assuming they were fired but didn't ask.  They now have an AI related startup as a Principal Engineer and have hit absurd levels of unscrupulousness on LinkedIn, having people beg them for a job and continuing to pump out re-packaged articles.  The thing that really just bakes my noodle is why these types of folks can't just redirect maybe 10-20% of their world-class bullshittery skills into learning how to actually do the fucking job.  10% is low.  It is much less common in Big Tech, I will say that, so there's an understandable defensiveness.  But Big Tech is such a small sliver of companies that hire programmers.  Especially in the time period of 2000 - 2020 or so, there were so many companies going from having 0 technical presence, to needing a full IT department.  The managers didn't know tech and were exploited.",6,2024-11-29 17:31:08,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a_Vz2ytVCQ#comment-lzl4as0

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a_Vz2ytVCQ,m01ucn8,danhorus,"I read that paper. Here's everything bad about it.  For starters, the paper is a preprint. It's not published, and therefore, not peer-reviewed. New studies can have flawed methodology, and unless someone else points that out, the researchers can obtain spurious results and come to the wrong conclusions. People need to stop writing news articles about stuff they find on arXiv.  As Alberta mentions in her video, the paper is not about measuring engineer productivity. Instead, it is about collecting human feedback on random Git commits and then training a Machine Learning model to predict the same feedback for new commits. Why is that useful? The authors try to justify it with a big word salad, and then claim this method can ""supplement manual code reviews,"" but to me it looks like they're trying to tell companies which engineers to fire. The main author's posts on Twitter/X seem to corroborate this hypothesis.  The commits analyzed in the study were sourced from public and private Git repositories, all written in Java. The paper itself mentions this as a potential limitating factor for the model's ability to generalize results to other programming languages and paradigms. They also provide a list of object-oriented architectural elements, but fail to mention how these elements are evaluated by their static analysis tool. They also that the number of lines of code added/modified/removed is a good predictor for the scale and effort of engineering tasks, which in my opinion is very flawed reasoning. More on that later.  There are seven target metrics for the model to predict: time to write the code in hours; time to fully implement the change, including testing, in hours; experience of the commit's author, from Novice to Expert; difficulty of the problem that the commit tries to solve, from Very Easy to Very Challenging; maintainability of the commit, from Poor to Excellent; and two metrics about how well-structured the code is. Some of these metrics are quite subjective, and a correct assessment would require familiarity with the full codebase, associated JIRA tickets, discussions in the PR, and possibly with other codebases too.  The ""expert raters"" are ten people, seven of whom have manager/executive/director/VP titles, meaning they could be a bit rusty on reading and writing code. These people were tasked with reading 70 commits and filling in a spreadsheet with their classifications for the seven metrics above. This means that the researchers don't actually know how long it took for the commit author to write the code, or their level of experience. All they know is the guesses provided by the ""expert raters."" This is particularly problematic because, as the researchers admit, the raters do not agree on the commit author's level of experience, nor things like maintainability and code structure. Furthermore, the raters certainly did not have prior access to all private repositories for these commits -- some of them are private -- and they're likely unfamiliar with the development processes for all of these companies. As such, they lack vital context to properly assess end-to-end development time.  Regarding sample size, the authors claim that 70 commits is sufficient for statistically significant results, but that's because they're calculating 70 commits * 10 raters * 7 questions, which results in 4,900 data points. This procedure is incorrect. Each question is a separate target variable for the model to predict, therefore the authors actually have 700 data points for each dependent variable, which might no longer be statistically significant.  The researchers took these responses -- some of which are incoherent, and others which are best guesses -- and trained a Machine Learning model to predict them. The researchers used a Random Forest model, which is a collection of Decision Trees (think if-else statements). The problem is that Random Forest models cannot read and understand code. Their inputs are just numbers calculated by static analysis tools. As such, it is impossible for the model to determine the actual complexity of the code changes. Maybe the developer changed the color of a button, or maybe they fixed a race condition or a deadlock caused by improper mutex management. For the model, it's all the same.  The model purportedly predicts the guesstimated development time fairly well, but it fails to predict author experience and code maintainability. It is, however, quite decent at predicting the incoherent code structure metrics. The paper does not include plots of confusion matrices, ROC/AUC curves, or any discussion about the predictions themselves.  I think now it's important to take a step back and look at the big picture. The authors are trying to look at Git commits and predict things like development time, developer seniority, and code quality. However, at the end of the day, they developed a Machine Learning model that's moderately accurate at predicting other people's incoherent guesses.  From my experience, development time varies a lot based on team size, industry requirements, collaboration within the team and with other teams, developer tooling, approval processes, and even individual experience. The commit history does not have that information.  Not only that, code is merely one output of an engineer's working day, and at times it's not even the most important of their contributions. Sometimes, changing a single line of code saves thousands of dollars a month. Other times, analyzing a potential feature and realizing it has low ROI saves months worth of engineering effort. The commit history does not inform us about the impact of a change, or anything the engineer does outside of Git.  In the end, this is a fundamentally flawed approach to evaluate an engineer's performance.",2,2024-12-02 15:58:14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a_Vz2ytVCQ#comment-m01ucn8

I think that a lot of people have something that they personally would love to devote their time to, but is very hard to make a living out of, while still being a net positive to the community.  However, I do think we have already reached a time where more and more people lose their job to AI:s in one way or another so we do need to find a solution that could work in the present.  I also recognize that it would take some serious scrutinization of these companies and a rework of the tax system to make sure the millions of people who will lose their job have a way to survive.  I just don't think laws to protect human jobs would be very effective, they would be rather counter productive. If the AI can do the job, then what is the human supposed to do? What purpose do they serve in the company now? I am not saying that they are worthless as a human, I'm just saying they are just not needed anymore.

""Well... The AI is not replacing the human job, the human job is just not needed anymore because of a leaner and more efficient organization"". Also, how would this protection even look like? And why should the companies not be legally allowed to use AI to improve the efficiency of their organization? I'm simply trying to say that the jobs that are lost are already lost and as long as the companies get the result they want they are not going to go back and neither should they.  Maybe it could work as a form of transition period. But even then, trying to protect jobs that are no longer needed is a band-aid for a much larger issue.

Google search quality declines because they are prioritizing ad revenue. Overwhelming the search with ads and affiliate links rather usable results. It also ponders how the increased AI integration will only make this worse. Ultimately concluding that people are likely going to seek out other engines. I myself doubt the latter, even though I always tell everyone to use anything but google.  It's a good read, I would recommend it. The follow up is pretty scathing too. Google denies the allegations of the divisions collaborating, but the evidence shows that ad revenue heavily influences google's direction at the cost of the user experience.  btw, you can just feed the article into chatgpt for summaries.",7,2024-10-30 19:56:37,https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-men-who-killed-google/#comment-luktee9

It's a rant, there's a lot in there (and this is my interpretation, so it might not be perfect). In context, the blog goes into what's wrong with the organisation (and I guess the industry as a whole), and really how C++ overall is on shaky ground with its current leadership, and how it's very unlikely that ""safe C++"" the way the US government wants it is ever going to happen. Slightly offtopic for this thread: the reason Izzy is communicating is that the community *just plain old doesn't want it*. There's a lot of song and dance about them pretending to want it when they actually don't.  In that context, she mentions Andrew Tomazos, and how he basically got ChatGPT to write his proposal instead of doing it himself. Reading between the lines this is a pattern of behaviour and the overall C++ leadership are sick of his bullshit.  While ""The Undefined Behavior Question"" is insensitive, I don't think people are saying he did this on purpose, but that's the problem with dogwhistles, so he's still got to clean it up. They're overall just asking him to fix his proposal both with this and the ChatGPT. But overall, they just don't like him, for both reasons which are valid (he uses ChatGPT) and reasons which are not (The leadership have their own preferred ""answer"" to the ""question"").  He doesn't want to do the work, so he's just complaining to anyone who'd listen.  Re-iterating, I'm not Izzy, I'm not ""in the know"" with C++, it's just how I read the tea leaves of the rant, and it certainly seems like a fuller picture than the video.",1,2024-12-03 05:00:37,https://youtu.be/SLPVo6tsFXo?si=zS8mEG5Z1ZDrD9-_#comment-m05n39i

https://youtu.be/SLPVo6tsFXo?si=zS8mEG5Z1ZDrD9-_,m0mm48v,Altruistic_Shake_723,"Hilarious assertion. Let's ask a neutral party...  It appears Advanced-Tree7975 is engaged in some rhetorical gymnastics here. Let's break down what's happening:  1. Earlier they strongly implied that the phrase ""The X Question"" was inherently problematic and linked to Nazi propaganda, particularly when combined with something ""to be eradicated"" 2. Altruistic\_Shake\_723 points out this is absurd by revealing:    * The actual title is ""The Undefined Behavior Question""    * It's in an esoteric academic context    * Sarcastically notes that if ""the"" + ""question"" triggers them, it shouldn't automatically trigger everyone else 3. Advanced-Tree7975 responds with ""I didn't say anything like that"" - which is clearly false given their earlier comments 4. When called out for backpedaling, they try to claim ""Pointing out a fallacy in your argument is not backpedaling""  This is indeed clownish behavior because:  1. They're pretending they didn't make the original inflammatory accusations 2. They're incorrectly using terms like ""strawman"" and ""fallacy"" to deflect from their own shifting position 3. They're refusing to acknowledge that their initial interpretation was overly broad and inappropriate given the actual academic context  They're essentially trying to maintain their position while simultaneously denying they ever held it, which is why the exchange has become so circular and absurd.",1,2024-12-06 00:18:40,https://youtu.be/SLPVo6tsFXo?si=zS8mEG5Z1ZDrD9-_#comment-m0mm48v

""be nice"").  Then to turn into the bully by retroactively turn a watered-down trademark into a weapon. Again, this could be a mental blindspot.  I don't think he wants to be a bully, but who knows?  No business can reason with the weaponizing, possible moving of goalposts, arbitrary demands and no guarantees. There's just no middle ground when someone employs ""nuclear option"" and outs everything publicly. Just being entirely obtuse and opaque about it as well. It's so shady and lack of lawyering, that lawyers cannot recommend anything but full-on defence.  So if he's not wanting to be a bully, at least it smacks of grandiose incompetence.  If this is the moment trying to be a bully, it just faceplants and is just going to hurt everyone around him.  This looks like personality issues, from surface-level view.

This is a very good test. Note that it isn't just about code, but also about data representation in general.  Vice versa, if you _don't_ need to change all the occurances of a repetition in sync, but need to do something special/specific in certain cases, then the DRY principle _doesn't_ apply.  Factoring out repetitions together that are not representing the same knowledge is just as much a violation of the principle as leaving multiple representations of the same piece knowledge.  And this is likely the issue people have with DRY:  When it's applied wrongly, then the result is often worse than not doing anything. But that's not an issue with DRY, it's an issue with misunderstanding it at a fundamental level.  You mentioned SRP: Same issue here.  When people do what I call ""Kindergarten OO"" and factor out all sorts of nouns out of a perfectly fine program (see: InvoicePrinterFactoryManager), instead of modelling the code in terms of data and computation, a similar thing happens.

You notice common patterns, the APIs work in very similar ways in terms of authenticating, updating their schema, how they respond to specific requests, their end point structure and so on...  Your code is very repetitive on a surface level. But this is _not_ a violation of DRY. For the most part they just _happen to_ share similar principles and patterns.

In fact you'd be shooting yourself in the foot, because you would be representing different pieces of knowledge that just happens to be similar as the same.

That's why duplicating that knowledge would violate DRY.,1,2024-06-21 15:48:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1dl262w/prime_doesnt_understand_the_dry_principle/#comment-l9mpl42
https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1dl262w/prime_doesnt_understand_the_dry_principle/,l9mynom,N/A,"mTLS isn't set in stone you know. And if your implementation is using a library, that library could change its API and then you are in the same situation of your ""counterexample"".   Furthermore, mTLS has many features and some of your services might use all of them and some others might use the basic mTLS authn flow.  Anyway. I think I get your ""understanding"" now... It still seems to me that DRY is in most of the cases obsolete then, as you will usually have at least one developer who is senior enough and can identify when duplication of code doesn't violate DRY.  For me, I think all principles are not the best way to ensure that developers write great code because they have backfired on many levels. Instead of helping junior developers learn in an effective manner what are the best practices of swe, it raised a generation of developers that apply them blindly. I know they were created with good intentions. But it's oblivious to not see that they haven't achieved what they were meant to achieve at best and backfired at worst.  The alternative for me is to talk about concepts that are nuanced and could not be defined out of a context like how the principles can be used. And the only two words I have in mind are: coupling and cohesion.",3,2024-06-21 16:39:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1dl262w/prime_doesnt_understand_the_dry_principle/#comment-l9mynom

But I learned in college, can read it, probably could write it again if I wanted too.  Back when I was in college Java was a very bloated language and ecosystem. It was very verbose which in a corporate setting at the timr was seen as good as it expressed intent very precisely. But reality it seemed like you had to follow very specific ritual to make things work, so it felt like you were in warhammer 40k praying to the omnisiah, rather than programming a machine. Java was also real slow. With its baggage huge improvements were difficult, but my understanding is that recent versions have greatly improved it, and other languages that make use of the JVM, like Scala, showed up to cover some niches that Java wasn't feeling quite right.  So, no, I don't think you chose wrong, Java is still relevant and a lot of companies use and like it. Knowing how to deal with the JVM is good experience. And to be fair, after some time with any language you start feeling it's drawbacks, and to me it sounds like that's what's happening to you.",2,2024-12-16 22:24:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1hfurb5/i_need_someone_to_talk_to/#comment-m2eghk2

https://www.gauge.sh/blog/ai-makes-tech-debt-more-expensive,lxakl65,lord_braleigh,"> My CTO is laughing while writing my PIP  It depends on your role. If your role is to ship products, ship products.  Some people have a role based around refactoring, though. These people aren’t just refactoring for the sake of good code, though. They’re typically solving a specific problem, at scale, with leadership buy-in, because the existing code has caused problems that have been root-caused to specific recurring patterns. And when they’re done, the code usually looks worse than it did before, because implicit problems have been made explicit. The most common work in this domain is improving type-safety or migrating to a newer typechecker, while silencing all the new warnings that the new typechecker has caught.  And truly good code is its own reward, even if your manager doesn’t reward it. If you spend time writing code that really is that easy to work with, it will make you more productive, enabling you to accomplish more work in less time and providing dividends even if your boss never knows about it. But most of the time we think our own code is better than it is, and one person’s “clean code” is another person’s hot garbage. That’s why Primeagen sometime says that “clean code” is a myth.",2,2024-11-15 17:13:42,https://www.gauge.sh/blog/ai-makes-tech-debt-more-expensive#comment-lxakl65

It's worse when you have an API with state, and something like next js, which is effectively SSR, but you have to retransmit state on both server and client again.  Htmx for simple + some JS when you need client side dynamism, and you can get some quite complex stuff going on.   Idk where you get this jquery bs from with ES2024 in town. Modern DOM has fetch API, document.querySelector, and a ton of other standardized shit that renders jquery useless.  I can do the same shit with html + scss + dom js stack as i could with react SPA or nextjs. In fact, I can do MORE because I get a single line of communication to the DB and can render permission based contexts on the fly ONCE.  Modern frontend development is fucking skitzophrenia my dude. Htmx alleviates a lot of very simple things. Extreme complexity is an option.",2,2024-11-16 01:18:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gs2u3p/htmx_is_trash_change_my_mind/#comment-lxd2qsm

We have no evidence that this vulnerability was exploited by a bad actor. While as the researcher shared in a public post, the specific issue they presented has been remediated, it is important that we provide clarity about what happened. This “supply chain” vulnerability, a type of vulnerability where bad actors may potentially attempt to exploit interconnected systems in order to breach organizations, reflects the type of security risks faced by many companies due to the way modern business tools are linked.  We also want to address the Bug Bounty program associated with this case. Although the researcher did initially submit the vulnerability through our established process, they violated key ethical principles by directly contacting third parties about their report prior to remediation. This was in violation of bug bounty terms of service, which are industry standard and intended to protect the white hat community while also supporting responsible disclosure. This breach of trust resulted in the forfeiture of their reward, as we maintain strict standards for responsible disclosure.""",3,2024-10-12 22:53:33,https://gist.github.com/hackermondev/68ec8ed145fcee49d2f5e2b9d2cf2e52#comment-lrmyfjk

This unpublished paper is the only validation I've found of their software-based approach to code commit evaluation. Their results are based on ten ""Java coders"" evaluating 70 selected commits out of 1.73 million commits.      \- The 70 commits were selected to ""match"" the lines of code (LOC) distributions of the 1.73 million. But BIG GAP: that distribution is not specified, and the selection process is not described. Also, the paper doesn't explain why matching LOC distribution is better than other potential sampling strategies, what biases might be introduced by not matching the LOC distribution, how matching LOC distribution relates to the study's goals of predicting expert evaluations, and whether LOC distribution is actually representative of commit complexity or difficulty.      \- The ten ""Java coders"" were 3 Senior Engineers, 3 Managers, 2 Executives, 1 Director, and 1 Vice President. But BIG GAP: The Java version is not specified; on GitHub, Java 17 (3 years old, LTS) is the majority, with other older versions that are like Java 8 (8 years old). The three Senior Engineers are likely have substantial Java 8 experience.  The three Managers might have early Java 8 experience.  The four higher managers are likely to have mainly indirect exposure through code reviews/architecture.  \- The inter-rater reliability of the ""Java coders"" is high. But BIG GAP: The confidence intervals are not provided.  \- The authors tout that they have 70 commits x 10 ""Java coders"" x 7 questions = 4900 data points, claiming this large sample size given their study substantial statistical power. But BIG GAP: The power analysis is not provided.       \- Their questionnaire provides at most an estimated 18 bits of data, which can seem like a lot, but the ten ""Java coder"" answer correlations and the Fibonacci scale used reduces their sample to \~245 data points. That means their study has confidence intervals at worst \~0.25 percentage points wide.",1,2024-12-07 19:37:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gzky88/95_of_software_engineers_do_virtually_nothing/#comment-m0x01pv

However, from my experience the conclusions still do not surprise me. I work with a portfolio of SaaS companies. There is no good measure of developer performance and productivity. So, in most companies, they don't bother to attempt to measure nor manage. They assume that all developers are high-performing. The other problem is that most companies promote a senior developer to a position of management without giving them any training. They don't want to have conflict and so tend to sideline poor performers without actually removing them from the team.  Why do I say this? I've been in many board meetings where the observation is made: ""We fire 10% of poorest sales people every 6 months, we never fire engineers for poor performance. Are we saying that all of our engineers are excellent?"". The same board members are on other boards and make the same observation from SaaS company to SaaS company.

There is times when for a good period of time, I barely commit any code at all to some repositories.   That does not mean I am not working, in fact, when this happens, it’s usually when it’s the most intense and stressful moments.   There will be a lot of testing, a lot of code review and merge request review. Lots of meetings. Lots of “pair programming” (or pair debugging if I am being truthful) and very little code is being committed, and mostly not by me.   I do not need to get my name in the commits, even if it’s my solution, my ego has an ego of its own and doesn’t need that deep green commit graph.    I take pride instead on my team doing well instead.   That said, when it’s the least stressful is when most of the team has very little amount of commits per day but I have a ton of them. It’s usually when I have time to properly think and refactor bits and pieces here and there (better names, clearer comments, better interfaces, better organization) or, occasionally, refactor bigger sections (say we rushed to get a feature out the door then through usage realized some parts of it aren’t really needed and could be simplified out in order to gain robustness).  Or it could be areas that aren’t directly code related like improving CI, image size, infra-as-code structure, improving documentation like product guide and tech guide (yeah, one of those, I know), etc.   The Portuguese have a saying: “During war time no one cleans guns”.

I'm talking your average marketing website WordPress templates or converting Figma designs to some React components. Sure, they may have some novelty here or there, but it is mostly a laid down path with pretty repetitive work.  But even still, with how slow most corps move, how error prone AI currently is, and how much handholding by a real experienced developer it needs, I figure people who do work like that would have plenty time to level up their abilities. And leveling up your abilities should be something you do anyway, in any field, if you care about having a healthy career that is.  For all other type of development, I don't see it being a problem just yet. If anything, I foresee a future where senior devs like me would have even more job opportunities due to all the clusterfuck work that AI assisted development is currently producing, and with more and more devs coming out of uni mainly knowing how to prompt AI and not do any actual thinking.  That said, after 14 years of being a dev without a degree, I enrolled in uni to do a comp sci BSc in AI, because why not.

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1hj61gc/openai_o3_the_hype_is_back/,m388r9l,Bjorkbat,"My biggest gripe with the ARC-AGI results was that they fine-tuned o3 on 75% of the training set.  Which, to be clear, is honestly kind of fine.  There's an expectation that models use it in order to basically teach themselves the rules of the game, so to speak.  My gripe is that they DIDN'T do the same thing with the o1 models or Claude, and as such it's potentially misleading and makes the leap in capabilities between o1 and o3 seem more massive.  Personally I think a conservative estimate is that on the high end o1 could score roughly 40% if you fine-tuned it on the training set, maybe 50%.  That would make the increase in capability seem like less of a sudden jump.  Besides that, something I only recently found out is that the communication around FrontierMath is also kind of misleading.  You've probably heard by now that a lot of famous mathematicians have commented on how ridiculously hard the problems are.  The kicker is that they were specifically talking about the T3 set of problems, the hardest set of problems in the benchmark.  I want to say 25% and 50% of the questions in the bench are T1 and T2 respectively, the former being very hard undergrad level problems, and the latter being very hard grad level problems.  T3 is the research set, the expectation being that it takes the equivalent of a Fields Medal mathematician to solve one of those problems.  To clarify, it's still impressive that o3 scored a 25% since LLMs normally can't do math (as evidenced by the fact that previous SOTA was 2%), but miscommunication around the contents of the benchmark have led to people making a slightly bigger deal of this.  In general though, I've given up on benchmarks being a proxy for, well, anything.  Hypothetically speaking, if a model got 90% of FrontierMath I don't think you could draw any conclusions about how well it would perform outside of math.  With programming, the reason why we have SWE-bench is because models were getting high scores on coding benchmarks but couldn't generalize that performance to the real world.  Even with SWE-bench we're still finding that models can do much better than you or I could but are still bad at generalizing that ability to problems you face at work.  Prior to o3, o1 scored better than 89% of all competitors on CodeForces and yet was about as effective as Claude.  Knowing that, ask yourself if o3 beating 99.8% of competitors really matters.  Only way to really know how good it is is to try it out, until then just remember that for all the hype and noise o1 got, Claude is just as good if not better at it when it comes to programming.",4,2024-12-22 02:25:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1hj61gc/openai_o3_the_hype_is_back/#comment-m388r9l

As I see it, AI is useful for simple code generation, for answering simple lookup questions efficiently, and for explaining things. It has gotten much better at those tasks since the original ChatGPT.  What LLMs are currently not good for is produce definitive code architecture and implementations for non-trivial problems. Admittedly I am not a prompting expert, but I have used OpenAI's and Anthropic's models for coding extensively. I always run into the same issues: LLMs rarely give definitive answers, they constantly change their own solutions, and you can never be sure that what they say is correct.  Without solving the correctness problem, LLMs will remain advanced code autocompletion tools. To get good results with LLMs so far, you always have to point them in the right direction for complex tasks. They will oversee an error 20x times, even if you keep prompting to check for errors, even if you keep prompting for more far-reaching error checking strategies.

But one things I’ve noticed with systems like ChatGPT is if you repeatedly prompt it for a task it is not performing that well for, with appropriate context inserted during the response generation process, it does a pretty good job at correcting itself and eventually arriving at something 60-70 percent correct (which can obviously be taken over and fixed). Now if we were to scale this out in such a way that we can break the problem down into multiple steps and have different experts scale out their response generation process to a very very large set of CoTs with self reflection, especially if streamlined to solve a targeted set of solutions, it would definitely do a much better job than today’s systems (like how they tuned the system to solve a specific task like ARC AGI). I’m sure this approach will increase the reliability of these systems greatly, especially when targeted towards specific solutions. Coupled with evaluators, self reflection at scale, if the cost part of it can be figured out, this can reach human level performance/outperform on a very specific range of tasks, coding being one of them.",1,2024-12-22 01:55:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1hj61gc/openai_o3_the_hype_is_back/#comment-m384hyh

https://youtu.be/Ot9K3Rgfugc?si=VGzHvrPi6vyhrBZj,lrso3kq,tehsilentwarrior,"TLDR: guy is angry that NeoVim checks for config errors and tells you.   That’s basically the whole rant. Except it’s disguised as “NeoVim fails at supporting basic software design”, which is wrong.   Browsers need to cater to hundreds of old/broken/opiniated/plainly wrong/etc implementations of incomplete “standards” (who really aren’t, they are more of a “hey many users use a software which behaves this way, let’s do it too”. Which is why developers who want to cater to as many people as possible build their apps to have “progressive enhancement” which is another term for “let’s try and feed plain turd because our user is too stupid to upgrade their browser” (or in the case of this guy, “the user wants to hack/mess with the experience we created, therefore let’s feed him some basic stuff”  Here’s a thought: don’t use it. You don’t have to use NeoVim. Vi still works. Vim still works great use those. If others want a more modern approach, which CORRECTLY checks for a wrong configuration option (which.. if you feed it to NeoVim, which doesn’t have it, it is wrong!) why would you say the developers don’t understand progressive enhancement?  This is a tool catered to devs, not someone’s grandma who doesn’t know how to update her software.   If this guy wants to have one config and feed several apps, and assuming he is a programmer, make a script to configure each correctly from a master config file.   It makes no sense to have one configuration for different apps because the behavior over time changes and one setting might mean something in the past and today yield a different behavior. This is true even for small version changes (minor should be fine tho).  Absolutely L take, for multiple reasons.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25v2d7zexo.amp,lo6sroc,Napalm-1,"Hi everyone,  First of all, this has an important symbolic impact for the nuclear industry  Second, Three Mile Island reactor 1 not only needs uranium for the annual consomption, but also 3 times the annual uranium consumption of that reactor to create the new 1st core of the reactor.  While in the meantime the uranium sector is in a structural global uranium supply deficit that can't be solved in a couple years time  Recently Kazakhstan, responsible for \~45% of world uranium productions, also made a 17% cut in the promised uranium production for 2025 and said that their production in 2026 and beyond would also be lower than previously hoped  Followed by Putin recently suggesting to restrict uranium supply to the West (uranium and enriched uranium going through Russia, so this also includes uranium from Kazakhstan that is enriched in Russia before going to the West)  And before that production cut announcement of Kazakhstan, **the global uranium supply problem** looked like this:  page 10 of this presentation: [https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf](https://prod.cameco.com/sites/default/files/documents/Cameco-Investor-Presentation.pdf)  For those interested:  **Sprott Physical Uranium Trust** (U.UN and U.U on TSX) is a fund 100% invested in physical uranium stored at specialised warehouses for uranium (only a couple places in the world). Here the investor is not exposed to mining related risks.  Sprott Physical Uranium Trust website: [https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/](https://sprott.com/investment-strategies/physical-commodity-funds/uranium/)  Sprott Physical Uranium Trust is trading at a discount to NAV at the moment. Imo, not for long anymore.  A share price of Sprott Physical Uranium Trust U.UN at \~25.79 CAD/share or \~19.01 USD/sh gives you a discount to NAV of 3.00 %  An uranium spotprice of 120 USD/lb in the coming months (imo) gives a NAV for U.UN of \~40.00 CAD/sh or \~29.60 USD/sh.  And with all the additional uranium supply problems announced the last weeks, I would not be surprised to see the uranium spotprice reach 150 USD/lb in Q4 2024 / Q1 2025, because uranium demand is price inelastic and we are now steadily entering the high season in the uranium sector.  Alternatives:  **A couple uranium sector ETF's**:  * Sprott Uranium Miners ETF (URNM): 100% invested in the uranium sector * Global X Uranium index ETF (HURA): 100% invested in the uranium sector * Sprott Junior Uranium Miners ETF (URNJ): 100% invested in the junior uranium sector * Global X Uranium ETF (URA): 70% invested in the uranium sector  **Uranium Royalty Corp** (URC / UROY): the only Royalty and streaming company in the uranium sector with physical uranium and royalty revenues from current productions, like Langer Heinrich mine  **This isn't financial advice.

Well, I asked ChatGPT to do this in python and it did provide a great response, and even described pretty well what it was doing.  However, the short is incorrect, because you can't describe time complexity of a graph in terms of a single variable without special constraints on the number of nodes and edges. But if you ask ChatGPT the answer is (correctly) O((V + E) log V) for the solution that it used. But also because O(n log n) is not as a possible result of using Dijkstra's algorithm.  However, time complexity can be improved to O(E + V log V) if a Fibonacci heap was used instead (ChatGPT itself referenced this when asked about time complexity). ChatGPT admitted to not using the faster version when first asked for an algorithm.  In any case any interview question that asks you to implement a 50 year old algorithm is lulz anyway.",1,2024-09-16 16:13:44,https://v.redd.it/9etiq2awp5pd1#comment-lnfflez

It's also very well cached directly from the browser and if you did your versioning system and headers right (which are usually handed directly from the framework you use)  it doesn't have to be downloaded again unless you update it.  That means the first ever time you visit a site you will have to download a lot of stuff, much more than in an HTMX application on a react style website, but  subsequent visits will be slightly less heavy.  You also have to take in consideration that in most web application most of your hits will be either bounces or users that only enter once or twice.  All of those hits will be heavier in a javascript heavy site. so it really depends on the use case.",1,2024-03-11 07:45:50,https://youtu.be/1xKa4vxon_8?si=HhW7BoJdoZa__Rde#comment-kuc7e3c

He posts their example code projects to GH at [https://github.com/antonputra/tutorials/blob/main/docs/contents.md](https://github.com/antonputra/tutorials/blob/main/docs/contents.md) and sometimes the community contributes performance improvements to them after his video.  PostgreSQL vs SQLite is at [https://github.com/antonputra/tutorials/tree/main/lessons/223](https://github.com/antonputra/tutorials/tree/main/lessons/223),2,2024-11-10 15:32:11,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzQgr-TgBzc#comment-lwf8ing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzQgr-TgBzc,lwnwbpv,itsjustawindmill,"This claim from the GitHub page (and repeated in the video) is flatly wrong:  “Also, I’m not using transactions to be able to measure the performance of each query from the client side.”  Statements in uncommitted transactions still go to the server. Their results are not yet visible to other transactions (which is good!) but that doesn’t mean that data isn’t being read/written to the database. It is valid to measure transaction vs non-transaction performance, but this isn’t doing what the author thinks it is. The server is ALWAYS tracking the in-progress state of transactions.  Edit: Also, running the Postgres client on a separate node is a major confounding factor, because it incurs network latency that you obviously won’t get with SQLite. While it’s typical to connect to Postgres from a different node, when you want a head-to-head performance comparison this is going to majorly screw things up. Especially with serial benchmarks.",1,2024-11-11 23:29:25,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzQgr-TgBzc#comment-lwnwbpv

Results force you to handle the error, always, but this is a bad thing to him apparently? Oh if I propagate the error I now also have to return a result? Duh. I don't have to propagate tho, I can choose a recovery path, or I can choose to panic, or I can choose something else. It's all quite ergonomic using chaining too.

https://cedardb.com/blog/exceptions_vs_errors/,lmkw7uu,SuperV1234,"This article feels like someone trying to find arguments and justifications in favour of an existing opinion/bias.  > Compare this to functional-style errors, where error handling is manual and super tedious. You have to explicitly check if the return value is an error and propagate it.  No, you don't. You can easily convert a functional style error into an exception on the call site *explicitly* (e.g. `std::optional<T>::value` in C++, or `.unwrap()` in Rust), propagate via language features (e.g. `?` in Rust) or library abstractions such as monadic operations.  The fact that you *explicitly* have to check the return value is a massive win in readability and ensuring that the ""error case"" was considered by the caller. That is paramount for the robustness of any codebase.  > But there’s much more: Allocations can fail, the stack can overflow, and arithmetic operations can overflow. Without throwing exceptions, these failure modes are often simply hidden.  Turns out there is a good use case for exceptions: exceptional and rare errors that cannot be reasonably handled in the immediate vicinity of the call site.  Exceptions and error types can and should coexist nicely.  > The classic example is syscalls, which usually follow C conventions.   Yes, C error handling from decades ago sucks at providing information and context for the source of the errors. This is not an intrinsic issue with error return types, it's just another thing that sucks about C and is the way it is because it's *old*.  > We parse an int somewhere, and an `IntErrorKind::InvalidDigit` bubbles up at the user.  How is that a bad thing? Either the user provided the string that should have been parsed, therefore it's useful information for them to know why it failed to parse, or they don't care much, and they can *explicitly* decide to convert the error into an exception and propagate it upwards.  Again, it forces the user to think about the error case, which is excellent!  > The following examples use C++ code, which allows us to compare both versions like for like: [...]  Now show a benchmark where the error rate is 50% or more.",3,2024-09-11 09:43:25,https://cedardb.com/blog/exceptions_vs_errors/#comment-lmkw7uu

Also, there are plenty of languages that allow you to construct pipelines, and you only need to handle the problem at the end. Pseudo-code:      var result = readFile(inputPath)       .map(bytesToUTF8String)       .map(str -> str.split(""\n""))       .filter(line -> line.startsWith(""needle""))       .findFirst()      switch (result) {       case Ok(str line) -> // do something with line       case None -> // nothing found       case Err(FileNotFound err) -> // file not found       case Err(AccessDenied err) -> // can't read       case Err(_) -> // unknown error conditions     }  Results chain way more easily than checked exceptions.

He just thinks that this way is not really suitable for indie game development.   I would say rust perfectly fits for larger games, as there are game designers, product managers and so on, and in the end programmers work having more or less well formulated task. But indie game development is different.   I am myself using rust for game development, and I am a day job programmer, not an indie. For us, rust is good. But I totally understand his complaints.  One of the things, that I highly agree in his article, is that game dev programming has two distinct scopes: system programming, when you create an engine for your game, and gameplay programming. And in my opinion for gameplay programming you do not need the language like rust or c++, where you can control (and thus you have think about it) whether variables are on stack or heap, decide which type of strings to use (and it is much more than just &str vs String, which is an obvious choice most of the times, but there also Rc<String>, Cow<Str>, external crates like smolstr or cowstr, etc.) Specifically with rust, you are actually quite limited in ways you can store your data, and providing access (especially mutable access) to your data is not that straightforward.

Coming from this guy, I tend to rather believe him.  On the other hand, it's not like it would eliminate jobs per se. Remember when Grace Hopper's dream was that executives (not even managers, she aimed real high) were able to program the business logic on their own, so she invented COBOL that it looked like English? So that didn't pan out. Turns out, typing on a keyboard and talking to a computer is a ""dirty"" job that the highly successful executive will rather delegate to some Bill or Kevin who are specifically good at speaking COBOL for fraction of the exec's bonus.  Same happened to all those drag-and-drop no-code platforms: rather than play with it themselves, business owners and ""subject matter experts"" tended to rather post a job for someone good with that platform. Eventually, it always comes to this.  LLM story is no different: while stating requirements is a job most C-suite will happily take credit for, they will rather hire people whose job is going to be to talk to GPTs. (And who are going to eat the crow when their idea doesn't pan out.)  Because most execs would rather have lunches with other execs, fly private jets, play golf, and do who knows what on closed late night parties to secure contracts, when push comes to shove.

Let's admit the following:  1. GPT-4-mini has much more knowledge about libraries, frameworks, languages, and other technologies than we do (the exception is probably the JavaScript world, which changes so fast that the LLMs' training dates become a dealbreaker). 2. GPT4o-mini has much better reasoning than we have (i.e. uses this knowledge better) 3. GPT4o-mini is much, MUCH faster than we are 4.

So we're not losing semantic understanding; we're making it more efficient and targeted by preprocessing the data intelligently before the LLM even touches it.  The LLM still does the heavy lifting of understanding and generating human-like responses, but now it's working with a much more focused, precisely retrieved dataset.

A small, probably synthesized, high-quality corpus, and the resulting model should be capable of extending its knowledge further. Now, that would be a breakthrough.  Claude, gpt, and all that shit are what they are, they are glorified word calculators, impressive, but word calculators nonetheless. You start with a prompt to write some code, you get a completion with code. You see that the code is bullshit, you point it out, the LLM apologizes and makes a ""fix"" that works or doesn't work, so you nudge it more until either it gives you the correct code or you give up. With hordes of humans correcting the models all the time, I'm not seeing them giving the correct answer to the same prompt the next week. They don't learn from their mistakes. You have to more or less repeat the whole journey, probably somewhat dependent on ""temperature"" or time of day fluctuations, but the damn things won't ""learn"" anything new because they can't think and it's a fool's errand to offload our thinking to them.   If you instead dedicate the same time you are wasting on your proompting to trying to actually understand what you're doing, you will get so productive you're gonna be metaphorically running circles around the LLM still apologizing to you while drooling from the corner of its digital mouth.

https://i.redd.it/o76v0eysrikd1.png,ljpthot,draculadarcula,"Professional Developer at a FAANG company (not one of the acronyms but think very large software company with hundreds of thousands of employees). The load, scale, and complexity I deal with every day is among the most traffic in industry. My problem space is hard, low code automation, we have hundreds of integrations and need to scale the automations for customers to infinite scale.  I’ve been coding for 12 years now, 7 professionally, so I’m no master but I’ve put in close to that magic 10,000 hours in coding. I’ve used copilot since the beta and am well versed in AI tools, early adopter.  Here’s my thoughts: copilot and its contemporaries are good at very simple and repetitive tasks. I don’t want to gate keep or sound pretentious but if you think these tools are more than mid, the problems you are tackling are not complex, they are simple   Half the time, these models just guesses incorrectly and I can’t use the suggestion. The other half of the time it gets the suggestion 80% right and I have to edit it anyways, which I could probably gain the same amount of productivity by just learning to type faster   Here is where it shines: answering programming questions I used to google search and crawl through GitHub posts / stack overflow is much easier to prompt for. It isn’t particularly helpful with errors but if I forget, like, “in this scenario is language X call by reference or value” it’s useful for that. These questions however become less and less frequent over the years, unless I am switching from my normal stack or learning something new I rarely ask these, maybe once a day if that   Otherwise, if I’m already doing a simple, repetitive task, like I wrote a unit test “does the code behave correctly when the feature flag is on”, it has a perfect example in context to write me “does the code behave correctly when the feature flag is off”, because it has a bunch of context and I already established a pattern for it manually.  Anything complex or non-repetitive it fails spectacularly in my complex problem space, new hires out of college are more productive",2,2024-08-24 15:29:19,https://i.redd.it/o76v0eysrikd1.png#comment-ljpthot

I think other people will come after us who will do again more high level thinking and also there will still be people doing high level thinking from our generation, who do tasks which can be less automated. But for a large amount of „average“ developers, it will mean they will still do the same job, just with less thinking, and more of the same. Compare it to this old picture from industrialization: people who used to build stuff after the invention of machines were doomed to push buttons all day, because they failed to find new demanding tasks and stayed in their jobs or companies. Not everybody works on the bleeding edge of tech and can search more demanding tasks when their old day job gets automated, a lot of the people will become button pushers essentially doing almost the same job, but less interesting. Automating things away will just mean increasing the speed and doing more of the same.  I am not saying it will be worse for everyone, but this will be the reality for many people.",1,2024-08-24 14:06:43,https://i.redd.it/o76v0eysrikd1.png#comment-ljpfhkk

For large, specialized codebases LLMs suck, but you can still go a long way with little homebrewed tools that have swarms of „if”s and regexes, and with generic linters. And those tools can be made to run on a 80486 and be faster and more useful than an LLM. And you don’t need to train these tools for months on all of Github and the rest of the Internet.

Bar missing  category of two, I don’t generally see people working in these areas in love with AI tools. I see people with simple problems, like SaaS product development, mobile app development, especially early in career engineers really loving the AI tools. It was certainly magic at a glance but not worth the hype for scale and complexity. I have no idea if your problems are complex, but I think in general AI does poorly with complex problems. Maybe it shines in some complex areas but not in my experience.   Finally I don’t think it’s the size and scale of the repos that it doesn’t work for me, there are two essentially similar reasons I think it does poorly for me  1. Much of the tooling at large tech is proprietary and internal. I don’t use shadcn and next.js that’s all over the training data, I use my organizational internal UX library and a custom build / run tool. You must concede LLLMs are better at more general than specific organizational problems independent of complexity. It straight up isn’t trained on our proprietary and can’t spit out code well for us.  2. I’ll out who I work for here, but these tools are very good at things like JavaScript, Python, React, C/C++ the types of things readily prevalent in the FOSS community. My org uses almost exclusively C# for backend, C# has a history of being closed source.

What about working with others or creating a dev group with people to share things? Being a solo dev is the dream for most, but in practice sucks on the long run.

It's about getting psyched to help someone else who is stuck and/or less-skilled than yourself, and being confident and able to solve problems, however big or small.  I work at a small dev agency and this is the thing that keeps me going for 15+ years.  Make sure the pieces are laid out in small wins first, that build up to bigger wins, and ultimately a successful project.  Small, easy but obvious and important wins and – in particular – getting that ecstatic client feedback early on are key to keeping you motivated when you would normally start to get bored.     And when you do get bored, think about the high you'll feel when you get that client feedback at the next big milestone.

A nice way to learn to me, try to recreate the same app you did with react but with vanilla Javascript. You will basically create your own mini framework and learn how things work under the hood in the process.   But if you want to keep doing leetcode to learn you can try this:  1. Try your own solution until it passes all the tests and it only break on timeouts. Most leetcode problem could be solved with a naive or brute force solution but then they had add some insane edge cases  like a 200k row list or a 2mb char string to force a timeout if you didn't use the optimal solution. If you want to learn you want to learn the naive solution without worrying at the big O notation first.  2. Look up the correct solution and spend max 30 minutes trying to understand how it works, if it doesn't click don't spend more time on it and pass and the next problem.  Those DP and binary tree problems are mostly pattern recognition there's a number of them and if you do enough of them you'll find the pattern and what solution you should apply to which one, oftentimes the leetcode test is not a good example of the problem to understand the solution, but the more you will find the same problem the easier is to understand it.   I had juniors solving things using a DP pattern that I thought was not useful and added useless complexity and asked them to refractor with a simpler and more understandable solution.  He tried to escalate it past me because their leetcode type solution was O(nlogn) and the one I proposed was 0(n^2), I had show him with tests on how his better big O notation was not actually at all faster with the real data we had and was using a lot more memory,",4,2024-06-18 06:33:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1di1wa3/struggling_with_real_programming_a_framework/#comment-l94b3u2

I’ve done a lot of vanilla JS and jQuery projects because at the time SPAs and client side UI frameworks weren’t really a thing. It becomes very apparent what a framework does when you remove it altogether or approach it with more of an understanding of what it looks like to build something without said framework. I eventually ended up building my own [awful] class-like view library just to see if I could improve my own development experience (I later realized what I made was just a worse version of backbone views). It wasn’t something I built for others to use, just more for me to try to understand what sorts of things UI frameworks do under the hood for you.  Maybe try building the same app you built in React without React and see what you come up with.

In Australia we have what we call 'superannuation', which is a system where we can contribute money to an investment portfolio which can only be accessed when we turn 60 years old. The reason people contribute is because of the tax incentives as well as our employers being required to contribute a % of our earnings there themselves.  There are many different organisations that are licenced to be able to handle someone's 'super' portfolio and the GCP issue concerns one called UniSuper. The portfolio's themselves were not deleted per se, people old enough to access the money were still receiving it. The main issue is that people lost access to check their balances and modify their investments.  My understanding is that the issue took place on Google's end but thankfully UniSuper had backups from a completely separate cloud provider. It is an interesting lesson into managing important data and for some things it looks like it does make sense to have redundancy that spans cloud providers. In the case of UniSuper they intentionally had backups being saved in two geographical regions within the GCP service but in this case even that was not enough and they had to rely on less up to date backups from a different provider.",5,2024-05-12 00:55:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1cpkt66/google_deletes_the_401ks_of_620000_australians/#comment-l3nezuh

They are obsessed with knowning everybody's politics, while actively trying to discover how somebody votes would be against the law in some countries because it violates their vote secrecy, which is what allows people to not be harassed for their political views, there isn't rules against campaining constantly, so you get constant political campaigns, and because americans have this thing for work, where they live to work and work a lot of hours, stay in the office a lot, a lot of their life goes on at work.

Maybe it’s my own experiences but I feel like having full-stack devs is faster. Just my own observations but it seems like development can go way faster with full stack devs as we often go back and forth where the frontend team implements a story, then later the backend team has to change something due to a change in business requirements and then frontend has to go and change their code. In the past when it was just our core team working on code or we were working with full-stack contractors, we were responsible for the entire story.

Full Stack meant *everything*: front end, back end, physical server installs, PM (both acronyms), network, helpdesk—basically, anything under the IT umbrella.

I've been developing software for over 30 years, professionally I've used many languages and done specialized work in everything from embedded through modern webdev with years spent in each part of ""the stack"". Many Principal engineers are probably ""full stack"" but the term doesn't mean what it originally intended. Mostly I see bootcamp grads that know Javascript and think using node makes them ""full stack"". I guess by some definitions it can, but when they say that I just nod and smile.  It's mostly a meaningless term in the general sense. Depending on the stack, you may need deep internal knowledge of many different things. Do you need to know k8s and devops systems? What about OS internals? Databases? What if you're on a RTOS? Or no OS at all (embedded). Is mobile part of it? No one can know everything or be an expert in even most areas. How ""full stack"" you need to be depends on the stack, project, or company.  I think the intended meaning is around can you manage to do the work for a project with or without another developer in a reasonable time frame. Does that mean all the code? What about requirements and product design? Okay what about sales and marketing? I became more ""full stack"" when I made a startup and literally had to do everything. Does accounting and taxes count as part of the stack? If you have your own startup, yea it probably does. If you work at a company, people probably expect it to stop at the code.  In my experience, what tends to separate the good staff+ engineers from the rest is not deeper technical knowledge in different parts of whatever stack you're working in. Most staff+ should have deep technical knowledge (and theoretical). The harder part is the soft skills and the business side of it. Good staff+ can manage their work, their teams work, to deliver projects effectively; despite the shortcomings of other parts of the organization. But anyway that's a bit of a tangent. Yes full stack exists, but it is a relative term, not absolute as many people like to claim. And most people that claim it probably aren't...they probably just want help landing a job. So at this point I just nod and smile when someone mentions it. No point ruining their day just to make me feel better about being old.",2,2024-12-01 00:03:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1h3bv6k/full_stack_developers_rage_the_rise_and_fall_of/#comment-lzskq9x

However, I see the term Full Stack generally used to describe a developer who can build both client— and server-side software. One hundred per cent a generalist with the skills and problem-solving ability to acquire deep technical knowledge on the job. The stack itself doesn't matter. Well, unless you're writing the job description for hiring the engineer – then it matters a bit.      As a business owner, I love the idea of sales, marketing, and accounting being part of ""the stack,"" especially if you're a startup. However, I'm reminded of the book The E-Myth. The core idea of the book is that a technician starts a business, hires an employee who can do everything, the employee leaves the business, and the business implodes.       The so-called soft skills of a developer, like communication and teamwork, are important. But many developers I've worked with don't have the skills or desire to manage people or be involved in the business; they want to go to their happy place and write code—who can blame them? I certainly have days like that!  P.S. I hear you on feeling old. I've been coding for cash for 15 years; somehow, everything has changed, and nothing has changed simultaneously.

So what I want to say is, when Lunduke cries wolf on something, he’s usually on to something, but he’s also quite biased so I’d verify his facts with other sources and probably discard the commentary to see if the facts on their own tell a story.

But actually, he and Guido could be considered co-creators of the language; Tim's involvement is extensive and vastly significant.  There's a legit concern about whether it's worth keeping someone who is technologically adept but an unpleasant person to be around. That concern does not apply to Tim, who is one of the nicest people I have had the pleasure of exchanging emails with. More emails recently than in the past actually, as we have both been tempbanned from the Python Discourse over the same matters - although since I'm not a core dev, I'm not a particularly significant person, and therefore just slapped with a short ban. But a LOT of people have been getting smacked around by the mods for daring to speak out in support of Tim.  Why did Guido retire as BDFL? Because everyone treated him badly. (Not to be confused with [PEP 401](https://peps.python.org/pep-0401/), which was a joke; I'm talking about the actual transfer of power.) I was also heavily involved in the PEP 572 discussions that became the last straw, and it was an astonishingly vitriolic discussion, emotionally charged rather than technological. And people were despising Guido (his word, not mine) for the decision. If people can't respect the BDFL and his decisions, do you expect them to respect a committee?

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1cvl880/what_are_git_aliases_you_use_a_lot/,l4pvzq2,tehsilentwarrior,I find git aliases to be useless and dangerous.   When dealing with something like git you want to be verbose and explicit.   In your case I usually just git commit -am “feat: my great new feature” && git push   It takes exactly the same time it takes to write an alias and its explicit. If commit fails (pre commit assertion for example) it won’t push   If I want to commit but not everything I just don’t supply “-a”.

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gst7l2/teach_me_simple_software_design/,lxh2oap,bowbahdoe,"There is a much longer version of this explanation to give, but the key thing is realizing that ""simple"" and ""easy"" are separate axes.  Something is simple when it is ""decomplected."" Quite literally just ""not entwined"" with other things.  Something is easy when the activation energy to initially accomplish a task is low.  Something like Ruby on rails is easy, but it is not simple. It complects all sorts of aspects of application development in the pursuit of easy.  Sometimes you can get both simple and easy, but not often. When you make your ThingManagers you are optimizing for making certain kinds of tasks easier, but you are doing that by complecting different aspects of your code.  A lot of the initial verbalization of this divide comes from the Clojure world. In that corner the line is drawn between data flowing through the system and the procedures that operate on said data. In this view even something like a data class adds complexity since you associate having some set of data with a nominal type.  So if you want to dive into it, maybe start there. Go far out of your comfort zone and come back later.  (Side shameless self plug: https://caveman.mccue.dev is my attempt at making a web framework for the Clojure ecosystem. I think it illustrates the difference between simple and easy implicitly. Part of it comes down to accepting higher linear costs to avoid unmanageable costs later.

Don't hard prescribe to any single methodology - do what makes sense.  Static utility classes are great for easy testability when they make sense.  DI + interfaces are great for services.  Sometimes it's great to make a complex class because it just makes sense to do it that way.  You don't have to abstract EVERYTHING out into an interface to test it. Honestly, that's a nightmare. Sometimes you can just instantiate the class and run tests on it.   The consistency that matters is that you consistently do what makes sense. String manipulation functions go in the StringHelper utility class. All our services use interfaces and DI and have a mock for testing. Workers implement this base class which makes testing them easy. This component needs a factory because XYZ.   But it's super tedious and messy to give everything a factory because ""we use the factory pattern"" or give everything an interface because ""we use direct injection"" (which a lot of people think requires an interface for some reason, but you really only need an interface if you're gonna mock it 🤷‍♂️)  Anyway, feel free to disagree, but that's served me well for 20 years.",2,2024-11-17 04:32:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gst7l2/teach_me_simple_software_design/#comment-lxjoym4
https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gst7l2/teach_me_simple_software_design/,lxhn8gy,Harotsa,"Maybe this will help with reframing some of the concepts. Obviously there is a ton of variation and complexity in all code, but this framing might help.  In SOLID OOP the main building block of code is the class, and instances of classes. A class is made up of two pieces: fields which represent state, and methods that are functions tied to the class. Because the main building block in SOLID is the class, it basically forces the use of inheritance and ClassMamagers in order to handle the complexities and nuances of software.  Instead of having your state and functions intertwined, you can instead think of them as two separate units. I think objects like structs from C or Go are very useful, and when I code in Python I used pydantic classes quite a bit, but mostly as a data struct without its own functions (with the notable exception being API clients and DB drivers which expose functionality in the form of a driver).  So if you were to write something in C# as myClass.method(a), instead you can write the code like this: method(myClass, a). Where method is now a function and myClass is now a data struct. And whenever you would write a unit test on a method of a test class, instead you just check the output of a function with the test data passed in as a strut.  This simplifies many aspects of the code from making control flow easier to follow, and having pure functions means you don’t have to think about any side effects that may have happened to your object.",3,2024-11-16 20:53:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gst7l2/teach_me_simple_software_design/#comment-lxhn8gy

I write typescript, and that's exactly my MO. Tbh, anyone who isn't following that is kind of eating shit and struggling, IMO.   The issue with most people is they dive into code immediately and don't really plan. It's the planning and high-level logic thinking that makes it simple. If you just code, you're executing while thinking. Consider the theory of sunk cost: you're 2000 lines into your app and just encountered a data problem that changes your entire data model and how a ton of shit functions.... so you just turducken your fix on top of your existing code, which was wrong to begin with, because you're so bought into your program that it the thought you should restart is dreadful... so you just added entropy and complexity fitting a problem that might not fit (no planning)... something perfectly solvable on paper using diagrams.  These diagrammatic exercises are the equivalent to interfaces and types in programming: they restrict what you do and tell you the shape of things.  Simplicity is to be an architect, not a brick layer.",1,2024-11-18 07:14:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gst7l2/teach_me_simple_software_design/#comment-lxq1bqc

You are describing how the object interacts with the other object, from their pov. It can be useful in come cases but I think that in most cases it will create more complexity than a straightforward approach. You want to write software with third person narration or from a birds eye view. Describing how the system work instead of how the pieces interact together. In my opinion, it is a subtle mindset shift that helps being explicit and keeping things simple.  An other way to look at it (a more pragmatic way I hope) is that only there is only data and data processing in software, the code you write transform the data in some way or another. It takes data as input and spit out more data as output like a pipe.  I feel like I struggle to get the point across, but it hope I could have shed some light on your interogations.",0,2024-11-17 01:25:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gst7l2/teach_me_simple_software_design/#comment-lxixakl

Cursor is a good example in on itself, Copilot is what it is, it doesn't have overall context of the project and if it does it's limited/faulty.    > ""Nobody will ever need more than 640k of RAM""  He isn't necessarily wrong.   Remember that there are two interacting aspects.   When something becomes cheaper you can use *more* of It at no additional cost.   Why does JavaScript use plenty of ram? Because when it was thought out that ram wasn't a concern, the more hardware evolves the more leeway you have to use more memory.    If for some magical reason RAM peaked at 640k we'd have become better and better at squeezing more stuff from those 640k.   But we didn't have to, so we didn't.   In a 640k peak ram universe you wouldn't have JavaScript, not because ""hehe JS bad"", but because real world constraints would have pushed engineers to take different approaches.    ----  Currently the LLM ecosystem *sucks*.   There are more LLM frameworks than JS ones, and they're coming out at an increasing pace.   The tooling is shit, there is no standard around anything, you can do the same thing in 400 ways and none is 'the best'.    Asking if LLMs are the panacea that will solve all world problems is the wrong question.   LLMs can be used to automate stuff that's hard to do but easy to check if the result is wrong.    There's plenty of that, and we can broaden that set of things by designing stuff in a way that it can leverage the strengths while minimizing the weaknesses.    A good reason why they suck is because we don't know how to use them effectively.   We can barely benchmark them.     Yes, using them to generate code is dumb, but it's because it currently is the wrong use case: code is hard to write and hard to check.",1,2024-09-30 11:45:29,https://sotergreco.com/what-llms-for-coding-should-actually-look-like#comment-lpmwcs1

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1dzdgs6/uncle_bob_video/,lcht6o2,Ceigey,"Hmm, I think take TDD workflows too strictly or literally; I think it’s explained in many different places, but essentially what they’re doing is: - declaring the smallest _useful_ interface and how it is expected to be used (“write one small test…”) - writing something to try and pass that (“write one line of code…”) - expand interface and use cases as needed - write code to cover new requirements until those are passed to  (With some variations on how that is tackled or explained; the main issues are “what’s a useful interface” and “what’s the smallest amount of code that needs to be written?”)  The main difference towards other testing philosophies is you write the test first, and go from there (working backwards essentially) instead of:  - trying out different ideas maybe in a REPL (eg Clojure devs) - displaying things on a UI (common in frontend, eg hot reloading; working against a Figma mockup is basically TDD for CSS in a weird way) - printing stuff out in the logs or using a HTTP client (common in backend)  The reason TDD people are doing what they do with tests is because they want to avoid getting stuck in their own implementation details and having the final interface full of implementation leaks, and also because then the test represents the requirements, rather than the minutiae of the implementation.  Bob’s stance is effectively “I don’t trust myself or most other developers to write a non-leaky implementation of something first and then a non-leaky test after”, where as Prime’s is effectively “I don’t trust myself to write a good interface without playing around with the implementation details first”.  Both are pretty valid options and at the end of the day this is more a trade philosophy than a hard scientific problem (which let’s face it would be very hard to research and test in a non-biased, reproducible way - not that people shouldn’t try).  And in the end this is not too alien to the way many people end up working. For example, you might work on a UI or CRUD controller first for an MVP, then flesh out the details from there. TDD is really just adopting that backwards “specification driven approach” for code and trying to make tests double as a form of documentation.  At the end of the day, for everyone who thinks too hard about this, there’s someone else practicing pure Vibe-Driven-Development 😂",3,2024-07-10 11:18:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1dzdgs6/uncle_bob_video/#comment-lcht6o2

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1f6bzsc/how_does_prime_navigate_his_cursor/,lkzdwjr,tehsilentwarrior,"What a bunch of useless answers guys. Cmon, you are better.   The cursor as in the text editor cursor? That’s Vim.   Basically it can jump words, multiple lines, paragraphs, methods and files.   In addition he uses a plugin he made himself called Harpoon. Which is “mark points” in normal vim but across files and with a single key combo. In PyCharm it’s called “Bookmarks” but there’s also Harpoon for PyCharm (or IdeaJ style editors) if you need extra features.   He uses Linux, which lets you use a window manager that is fully controlled by the keyboard called i3. In other OSes you can get something similar but not as powerful. i3 lets you switch windows and workspaces with a single button and also control window focus (like cmd+tab or control+tab) but without animations or anything like that, which makes it super fast.   Another thing he does is re-bind all commands to center the current line on screen. This way he only needs to look at the center of screen and it’s where the line is.   Normally if you jump around, the text “cursor” will land on the correct place but the screen will only sort of follow. With this, the screen absolutely centers itself on the line where cursor is.    With all this little things together, the effect is that he only looks at a very small part of the screen and only thinks about a very small amount of things, together with muscle memory of the keybinds, it means he looks like he has super powers and is way smarter than any of you.   That said, you can do the same thing and look as smart or smarter doing the same thing.    Btw I am not saying he isn’t smart, he is, but the jumping around screen isn’t because he is a genius (which he is but for other reasons). The jumping around is just an optimized workflow. It’s more entertainment (for him and you) than anything else, it looks cool and feels nice.    PS: he does use a mouse if necessary and I suggest you do as well.

Another thing is that if a ceremony doesn’t make sense, it should be changed or thrown away. Many people like dogmatic thinking too much to make it happen. Many managers build their KPIs around those ceremonies and will fight tooth and claw to keep them in.  Finally, the fat times when money used to be free created sick incentives where the appearance of doing lots of work became more important than the work itself. This is what people think about and cringe from when you mention scrum. Maybe one outcome of the hungry times is going to be cleansing of these practices.  Any methodology can work if the product and its quality are paramount and the framework is secondary and replaceable. Any methodology which enables you to think about work in a structured way is better than complete chaos where nobody knows anything. I admit this is a pretty low bar, though. ;-)",1,2024-10-31 10:34:18,https://blog.raed.dev/posts/scrum_doesnt_have_to_suck#comment-luoaf6s

Extremely eye opening given I don't have an engineering background (not counting software in that).   Understanding how your stuff is used is crucial and it's amazing how many devs I have met that think they know better than the customers when they don't use the product themselves.   Funnily enough every dev I have met that thinks like this fully understands the developer/consumer disconnect when it comes to video games. ""How can these game devs change the balance like this? Why didn't they address the bug that everyone knows is the biggest problem right now? Do they not play their own game?"".   No they don't.

A long, long time ago I went into welding inspection because workers were needed and the pay was phenomenal.  I had no business doing that job because I knew literally nothing about welds or welding, but because I had held a job dealing with inspection _data_ I qualified for certification via broad criteria.   I’ve worked with people in e-commerce who had never worked retail or operated a business selling things. You could definitely tell the difference between them and the devs who operated their own shops for years.   You reference mining, which interestingly is the industry my company caters to at the moment. Turns out having grown up in a mining community and using core samples as (albeit crappy) toys as a kid gave me an edge when it came to building visualizations.  Whether it’s from interacting with the humans using your work, or experiencing the domain first-hand, there’s _so much value_ getting out there.",2,2024-10-07 23:12:43,/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1fycv29/home_depot_software_devs_to_start_having_to_spend/#comment-lquu1np

Sure you could build your own edge network with AWS,GCS and Azure but you will pay through your nose and not be able to utilise it to the full extent.       If edge is not a concern sure you can use VPS hosting and host in different countries with specific sub domains like people used to do before and save more than a few bucks. Hostinger and Digitalocean are good providers.       I personally use azure web apps for containers given that I use docker compose a lot. If you want to do something like that then you can also spin up a second VPS server  (or in the same server itself), install gitea as a git remote server and configure it as a docker container registry. After that you can configure a CI/CD agent like jenkins (or whatever you are using) to monitor it and deploy on push.

https://youtu.be/PH9q0HNBjT4,lgnx4af,StartledPancakes,"I think you suffer from some misconceptions. The major difference between most mechanical engineering tasks and projects and serious software development is who does the implementation. It's rather more common to get a machinist to make a part, as a software developer you do both. Typically it's easier to fix broken code than a screwed up part... understanding logical proofs and the ideas and efficiency of different data structures, and the actual interaction with the physical world, like in firmware for instance, is every bit as demanding as typical calculus 2 and related stuff. Partial differential equations and beyond starts to outpace common difficulties in computer science though. In my opinion.   One other major difference is the bredth of knowledge required can be much deeper. For instance working with audio files today on a chip that handles that specifically I implemented from scratch a process to convert sound data using fft to a form that can be used to measure some target patterns from a microphone input on the Amp that gets the speaker signal back in a loop.   But I didn't make a YouTube dev diary about it so, it will not get much air time :D  I have degrees in computer science and mechanical engineering and have worked multiple years in both fields.",3,2024-08-05 20:26:15,https://youtu.be/PH9q0HNBjT4#comment-lgnx4af

Go ahead. Yes, instead of taking text and turning it into more text, more text, taking text and have the AI trigger actions. So another definition would be language to Python, a programming language I never wanted to see survive and everything in AI is being done in Python.  There’s a new language called Mojo that has just come out, which looks like they finally have addressed AI programming, but we’ll see if that actually survives over the dominance of Python. One more technical question. Why is NVIDIA worth $2 trillion and the other companies are struggling? Technical answer. I mean, I think it just boils down to like most of the code needs to run with CUDA optimizations that currently only NVIDIA GPU supports.  Other companies can make whatever they want to, but unless they have the 10 years of software there, you don’t have the machine learning optimization. I like to think of CUDA as the C programming language for GPUs. That’s the way I like to think of it. It was founded in 2008. I always thought it was a terrible language and yet it’s become dominant.  There’s another insight. There’s a set of open source libraries which are highly optimized to CUDA and not anything else and everybody who builds all these stacks, this is completely missed in any of the discussions. It’s technically called VLM and a whole bunch of libraries like that. Highly optimized CUDA, very hard to replicate that if you’re a competitor. So what does all this mean?  In the next year, you’re going to see very large context windows, agents and text action. When they are delivered at scale, it’s going to have an impact on the world at a scale that no one understands yet. Much bigger than the horrific impact we’ve had by social media in my view. So here’s why. In a context window, you can basically use that as short-term memory and I was shocked that context windows get this long.  The technical reasons have to do with the fact that it’s hard to serve, hard to calculate and so forth. The interesting thing about short-term memory is when you feed, you’re asking a question read 20 books, you give it the text of the books as the query and you say, tell me what they say. It forgets the middle, which is exactly how human brains work too. That’s where we are. With respect to agents, there are people who are now building essentially LLM agents and the way they do it is they read something like chemistry, they discover the principles of chemistry and then they test it and then they add that back into their understanding.",1,2024-08-19 17:38:48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwmgnz

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwmjrk,Fnordinger,"That’s extremely powerful. And then the third thing, as I mentioned is text to action. So I’ll give you an example. The government is in the process of trying to ban TikTok. We’ll see if that actually happens.  If TikTok is banned, here’s what I propose each and every one of you do. Say to your LLM the following. Make me a copy of TikTok, steal all the users, steal all the music, put my preferences in it, produce this program in the next 30 seconds, release it and in one hour, if it’s not viral, do something different along the same lines. That’s the command. Boom, boom, boom, boom.  You understand how powerful that is. If you can go from arbitrary language to arbitrary digital command, which is essentially what Python in this scenario is, imagine that each and every human on the planet has their own programmer that actually does what they want as opposed to the programmers that work for me who don’t do what I ask, right? The programmers here know what I’m talking about. So imagine a non-arrogant programmer that actually does what you want and you don’t have to pay all that money to and there’s infinite supply of these programs. That’s all within the next year or two.  Very soon. Those three things, and I’m quite convinced it’s the union of those three things that will happen in the next wave. So you asked about what else is going to happen. Every six months I oscillate. So we’re on a, it’s an even odd oscillation.  So at the moment, the gap between the frontier models, which they’re now only three, I’ll refute who they are, and everybody else, appears to me to be getting larger. Six months ago, I was convinced that the gap was getting smaller. So I invested lots of money in the little companies. Now I’m not so sure. And I’m talking to the big companies and the big companies are telling me that they need 10 billion, 20 billion, 50 billion, 100 billion.  Stargate is a 100 billion, right? That’s very, very hard. I talked to Sam Altman is a close friend. He believes that it’s going to take about 300 billion, maybe more. I pointed out to him that I’d done the calculation on the amount of energy required.  And I, and I then in the spirit of full disclosure, went to the white house on Friday and told them that we need to become best friends with Canada because Canada has really nice people, helped invent AI, and lots of hydropower. Because we as a country do not have enough power to do this. The alternative is to have the Arabs fund it. And I like the Arabs personally.

Whereas Canada and the U.S. are part of a triumvirate where we all agree. So these $100 billion, $300 billion data centers, electricity starts becoming the scarce resource. Well, and by the way, if you follow this line of reasoning, why did I discuss CUDA and Nvidia?  If $300 billion is all going to go to Nvidia, you know what to do in the stock market. Okay. That’s not a stock recommendation. I’m not a licensed. Well, part of it, so we’re going to need a lot more chips, but Intel is getting a lot of money from the U.S.  government, AMD, and they’re trying to build, you know, fabs in Korea. Raise your hand if you have an Intel computer in your, an Intel chip in any of your computing devices. Okay. So much for the monopoly. Well, that’s the point though.  They once did have a monopoly. Absolutely. And Nvidia has a monopoly now. So are those barriers to entry, like CUDA, is that, is there something that other, so I was talking to Percy, Percy Landy the other day, he’s switching between TPUs and Nvidia chips, depending on what he can get access to for training models. That’s because he doesn’t have a choice.  If he had infinite money, he would, today he would pick the B200 architecture out of Nvidia because it would be faster. And I’m not suggesting, I mean, it’s great to have competition. I’ve talked to AMD and Lisa Sue at great length. They have built a, a thing which will translate from this CUDA architecture that you were describing to their own, which is called Rockum. It doesn’t quite work yet.  They’re working on it. You were at Google for a long time and they invented the transformer architecture. Peter, Peter. It’s all Peter’s fault. Thanks to, to brilliant people over there, like Peter and Jeff Dean and everyone.  But now it doesn’t seem like they’re, they’ve kind of lost the initiative to open AI and even the last leaderboard, I saw Anthropix. Claude was at the top of the list. I asked Sundar this, he didn’t really give me a very sharp answer. Maybe, maybe you have a sharper or a more objective explanation for what’s going on there.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwmpa3,Fnordinger,"Google decided that work life balance and going home early and working from home was more important than winning. And the startups, the reason startups work is because the people work like hell. And I’m sorry to be so blunt, but the fact of the matter is if you all leave the university and go found a company, you’re not going to let people work from home and only come in one day a week. If you want to compete against the other startups with the early days of Google, Microsoft was like that. Exactly.  But now it seems to be, there’s a long history of in my industry, our industry, I guess, of companies winning in a genuinely creative way and really dominating a space and not making this the next transition. So we’re very well documented. And I think that the truth is founders are special. The founders need to be in charge. The founders are difficult to work with.  They push people hard. As much as we can dislike Elon’s personal behavior, look at what he gets out of people. I had dinner with him and he was flying. I was in Montana. He was flying that night at 10 PM to have a meeting at midnight with x.ai.  I was in Taiwan, different country, different culture. And they said that this is TSMC, who I’m very impressed with. And they have a rule that the starting PhDs coming out of the good physicists work in the factory on the basement floor. Now, can you imagine getting American physicists to do that? The PhDs, highly unlikely.  Different work ethic. And the problem here, the reason I’m being so harsh about work is that these are systems which have network effects. So time matters a lot. And in most businesses, time doesn’t matter that much. You have lots of time.  Coke and Pepsi will still be around and the fight between Coke and Pepsi will continue to go on and it’s all glacial. When I dealt with telcos, the typical telco deal would take 18 months to sign. There’s no reason to take 18 months to do anything. Get it done. We’re in a period of maximum growth, maximum gain.  And also it takes crazy ideas. Like when Microsoft did the OpenAI deal, I thought that was the stupidest idea I’d ever heard. Outsourcing essentially your AI leadership to OpenAI and Sam and his team. I mean, that’s insane. Nobody would do that at Microsoft or anywhere else.",1,2024-08-19 17:40:05,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwmpa3
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwmt92,Fnordinger,"And yet today, they’re on their way to being the most valuable company. They’re certainly head to head in Apple. Apple does not have a good AI solution and it looks like they made it work. Yes, sir. In terms of national security or geopolitical interests, how do you think AI is going to play a role or competition with China as well?  So I was the chairman of an AI commission that sort of looked at this very carefully and you can read it. It’s about 752 pages and I’ll just summarize it by saying we’re ahead, we need to stay ahead, and we need lots of money to do so. Our customers were the Senate and the House. And out of that came the Chips Act and a lot of other stuff like that. A rough scenario is that if you assume the frontier models drive forward and a few of the open source models, it’s likely that a very small number of companies can play this game.  Countries, excuse me. What are those countries or who are they? Countries with a lot of money and a lot of talent, strong educational systems, and a willingness to win. The US is one of them. China is another one.  How many others are there? Are there any others? I don’t know. Maybe. But certainly in your lifetimes, the battle between the US and China for knowledge supremacy is going to be the big fight.  So the US government banned essentially the NVIDIA chips, although they weren’t allowed to say that was what they were doing, but they actually did that into China. They have about a 10-year chip advantage. We have a roughly 10-year chip advantage in terms of sub-DUV that is sub-five Danometer chips. So an example would be today we’re a couple of years ahead of China. My guess is we’ll get a few more years ahead of China, and the Chinese are whopping mad about this.  It’s like hugely upset about it. So that’s a big deal. That was a decision made by the Trump administration and driven by the Biden administration. Do you find that the administration today in Congress is listening to your advice? Do you think that it’s going to make that scale of investment?  Obviously the chips act, but beyond that, building a massive AI system? So as you know, I lead an informal, ad hoc, non-legal group. That’s different from illegal. That’s exactly. Just to be clear.  Which includes all the usual suspects. And the usual suspects over the last year came up with the basis of the reasoning that became the Biden administration’s AI act, which is the longest presidential directive in history. You’re talking about the special competitive studies project? No, this is the actual act from the executive office. And they’re busy implementing the details.  So far they’ve got it right. And so, for example, one of the debates that we had for the last year has been, how do you detect danger in a system which has learned it but you don’t know what to ask it? So in other words, it’s a core problem. It’s learned something bad, but it can’t tell you what it learned and you don’t know what to ask it. And there’s so many threats.  Like it learned how to mix chemistry in some new way that you don’t know how to ask it. And so people are working hard on that. But we ultimately wrote in our memos to them that there was a threshold which we arbitrarily named as 10 to the 26 flops, which technically is a measure of computation, that above that threshold you had to report to the government that you were doing this. And that’s part of the rule. The EU to just make sure they were different did it 10 to the 25.  But it’s all kind of close enough. I think all of these distinctions go away because the technology will now, the technical term is called federated training, where basically you can take pieces and union them together. So we may not be able to keep people safe from these new things. Well, rumors are that that’s how OpenEye has had to train, partly because of the power consumption. There was no one place where they did.  Well, let’s talk about a real war that’s going on. I know that something you’ve been very involved in is the Ukraine war and in particular, I don’t know if you can talk about white stork and your goal of having $500,000, $500 drones destroy $5 million tanks. How’s that changing warfare? I worked for the Secretary of Defense for seven years and tried to change the way we run our military. I’m not a particularly big fan of the military, but it’s very expensive and I wanted to see if I could be helpful.  And I think in my view, I largely failed. They gave me a medal, so they must give medalists to failure or whatever. But my self-criticism was nothing has really changed and the system in America is not going to lead to real innovation. So watching the Russians use tanks to destroy apartment buildings with little old ladies and kids just drove me crazy. So I decided to work on a company with your friend Sebastian Thrun as a former faculty member here and a whole bunch of Stanford people.  And the idea basically is to do two things. Use AI in complicated, powerful ways for these essentially robotic war and the second one is to lower the cost of the robots. Now you sit there and you go, why would a good liberal like me do that? And the answer is that the whole theory of armies is tanks, artilleries, and mortar and we can eliminate all of them and we can make the penalty for invading a country at least by land essentially be impossible. It should eliminate the kind of land battles.",1,2024-08-19 17:40:40,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwmt92
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwn0un,Fnordinger,"Well, this is a relationship question is that does it give more of an advantage to defense versus offense? Can you even make that distinction? Because I’ve been doing this for the last year, I’ve learned a lot about war that I really did not want to know. And one of the things to know about war is that the offense always has the advantage because you can always overwhelm the defensive systems. And so you’re better off as a strategy of national defense to have a very strong offense that you can use if you need to.  And the systems that I and others are building will do that. Because of the way the system works, I am now a licensed arms dealer, a computer scientist, businessman, and an arms dealer. Is that a progression? I don’t know. I do not recommend this in your group.  I stick with AI. And because of the way the laws work, we’re doing this privately and then this is all legal with the support of the governments. It goes straight into the Ukraine and then they fight the war. And without going into all the details, things are pretty bad. I think if in May or June, if the Russians build up as they are expecting to, Ukraine will lose a whole chunk of its territory and will begin the process of losing the whole country.  So the situation is quite dire. And if anyone knows Marjorie Taylor Greene, I would encourage you to delete her from your contact list because she’s the one, a single individual is blocking the provision of some number of billions of dollars to save an important democracy. I want to switch to a little bit of a philosophical question. So there was an article that you and Henry Kissinger and Dan Huttenlecker wrote last year about the nature of knowledge and how it’s evolving. I had a discussion the other night about this as well.  So for most of history, humans sort of had a mystical understanding of the universe and then there’s the scientific revolution and the enlightenment. And in your article, you argue that now these models are becoming so complicated and difficult to understand that we don’t really know what’s going on in them. I’ll take a quote from Richard Feynman. He says, „What I cannot create, I do not understand.“ I saw this quote the other day. But now people are creating things that they can create, but they don’t really understand what’s inside of them.  Is the nature of knowledge changing in a way? Are we going to have to start just taking the word for these models without them being able to explain it to us? The analogy I would offer is to teenagers. If you have a teenager, you know they’re human, but you can’t quite figure out what they’re thinking. But somehow we’ve managed in society to adapt to the presence of teenagers and they eventually grow out of it.  I’m just serious. So it’s probably the case that we’re going to have knowledge systems that we cannot fully characterize, but we understand their boundaries. We understand the limits of what they can do. And that’s probably the best outcome we can get. Do you think we’ll understand the limits?  We’ll get pretty good at it. The consensus of my group that meets every week is that eventually the way you’ll do this so-called adversarial AI is that there will actually be companies that you will hire and pay money to to break your AI system. Like Red Team. So instead of human Red Teams, which is what they do today, you’ll have whole companies and a whole industry of AI systems whose jobs are to break the existing AI systems and find their vulnerabilities, especially the knowledge that they have that we can’t figure out. That makes sense to me.   It’s also a great project for you here at Stanford, because if you have a graduate student who has to figure out how to attack one of these large models and understand what it does, that is a great skill to build the next generation. So it makes sense to me that the two will travel together. All right, let’s take some questions from the student. There’s one right there in the back. Just say your name.  Earlier you mentioned, and this is related to this comment right now, getting AI that actually does what you want. You just mentioned adversarial AI, and I’m wondering if you can elaborate on that more. So it seems to be, besides obviously computer language reasons to get more performant models, but getting them to do what you want to do seems partly unanswered in my view. Well, you have to assume that the current hallucination problems become less as the technology gets better and so forth. I’m not suggesting it goes away.  And then you also have to assume that there are tests for efficacy. So there has to be a way of knowing that the things exceeded. So in the example that I gave of the TikTok competitor, and by the way, I was not arguing that you should illegally steal everybody’s music. What you would do if you’re a Silicon Valley entrepreneur, which hopefully all of you will be, is if it took off, then you’d hire a whole bunch of lawyers to go clean the mess up, right? But if nobody uses your product, it doesn’t matter that you stole all the content.  And do not quote me. Right. Right. You’re on camera. Yeah, that’s right.  But you see my point. In other words, Silicon Valley will run these tests and clean up the mess. And that’s typically how those things are done. So my own view is that you’ll see more and more performative systems with even better tests and eventually adversarial tests, and that will keep it within a box. The technical term is called chain of thought reasoning.  And people believe that in the next few years, you’ll be able to generate a thousand steps of chain of thought reasoning, right? Do this, do this. It’s like building recipes, right? That the recipes, you can run the recipe and you can actually test that it produced the correct outcome. And that’s how the system will work.",1,2024-08-19 17:41:48,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwn0un
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwn450,Fnordinger,"Yes, sir? [inaudible] In general, you seem super positive about the potential for AI’s problems. I’m curious, like, what do you think is going to drive that? Is it just more compute? Is it more data?  Is it fundamental or actual shifts? Yes. Do you agree? The amounts of money being thrown around are mind-boggling. And I’ve chosen, I essentially invest in everything because I can’t figure out who’s going to win.  And the amounts of money that are following me are so large. I think some of it is because the early money has been made and the big money people who don’t know what they’re doing have to have an AI component. And everything is now an AI investment, so they can’t tell the difference. I define AI as learning systems, systems that actually learn. So I think that’s one of them.  The second is that there are very sophisticated new algorithms that are sort of post-transformers. My friend, my collaborator, for a long time has invented a new non-transformer architecture. There’s a group that I’m funding in Paris that has claims to have done the same thing. There’s enormous invention there, a lot of things at Stanford. And the final thing is that there is a belief in the market that the invention of intelligence has infinite return.  So let’s say you put $50 billion of capital into a company, you have to make an awful lot of money from intelligence to pay that back. So it’s probably the case that we’ll go through some huge investment bubble, and then it’ll sort itself out. That’s always been true in the past, and it’s likely to be true here. And what you said earlier was you think that the leaders are pulling away from the rest. Right now.  And the question is roughly the following. There’s a company called Mistral in France. They’ve done a really good job. And I’m obviously an investor. They have produced their second version.  Their third model is likely to be closed because it’s so expensive, they need revenue, and they can’t give their model away. So this open source versus closed source debate in our industry is huge. And my entire career was based on people being willing to share software in open source. Everything about me is open source. Much of Google’s underpinnings were open source.  Everything I’ve done technically. And yet, it may be that the capital costs, which are so immense, fundamentally changes how software is built. You and I were talking. My own view of software programmers is that software programmers‘ productivity will at least double. There are three or four software companies that are trying to do that.  I’ve invested in all of them in the spirit. And they’re all trying to make software programmers more productive. The most interesting one that I just met with is called Augment. And I always think of an individual programmer. And they said, that’s not our target.  Our target are these 100 person software programming teams on millions of lines of code where nobody knows what’s going on. Well, that’s a really good AI thing. Will they make money? I hope so. So a lot of questions here.  Hi. So at the very beginning you mentioned that there’s the combination of the context window expansion. The agents and the text to action is going to have unimaginable impacts. First of all, why is the combination important? And second of all, I know that you’re not like a crystal ball and you can’t necessarily tell the future.  But why do you think it’s beyond anything that we could imagine? I think largely because the context window allows you to solve the problem of recency. The current models take a year to train roughly 18 months, six months of preparation, six months of training, six months of fine tuning. So they’re always out of date. Context window, you can feed what happened.  You can ask it questions about the Hamas Israel war in a context. That’s very powerful. It becomes current like Google. In the case of agents, I’ll give you an example. I set up a foundation which is funding a nonprofit.  I don’t know if there’s chemists in the room. I don’t really understand chemistry. There’s a tool called ChemCrow, C-R-O-W, which was an LLM-based system that learned chemistry. And what they do is they run it to generate chemistry hypotheses about proteins and they have a lab which runs the tests overnight and then it learns. That’s a huge acceleration, accelerant in chemistry, material science and so forth.",1,2024-08-19 17:42:18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwn450
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwn7b0,Fnordinger,"So that’s an agent model. And I think the text to action can be understood by just having a lot of cheap programmers, right? And I don’t think we understand what happens, and this is again your area of expertise, what happens when everyone has their own programmer. And I’m not talking about turning on and off the lights. I imagine, another example, for some reason you don’t like Google.  So you say, „Build me a Google competitor.“ Yeah, you personally, you don’t build me a Google competitor. „Search the web. Build a UI. Make a good copy. Add generative AI in an interesting way.  Do it in 30 seconds and see if it works.“ Right? So a lot of people believe that the incumbents, including Google, are vulnerable to this kind of an attack. Now, we’ll see. There were a bunch of questions who were sent over by Slatter. I want to get some of them were upvoted.  So here’s one. We talked a little bit of this last year. How can we stop AI from influencing public opinion, misinformation, especially during the upcoming election? What are the short and long-term solutions for them? Most of the misinformation in this upcoming election and globally will be on social media.  And the social media companies are not organized well enough to police it. If you look at TikTok, for example, there are lots of accusations that TikTok is favoring one kind of misinformation over another. And there are many people who claim without proof, that I’m aware of, that the Chinese are forcing them to do it. I think we have a mess here. And the country’s going to have to learn critical thinking.  That may be an impossible challenge for the U.S. But the fact that somebody told you something does not mean that it’s true. Could it go too far the other way? That there’s things that really are true and nobody believes anymore. You get some people call it a „pestimological crisis“ that now, you know, Elon says, „No, I never did that.  Prove it.“ Oh, let’s use Donald Trump. Look, I think we have a trust problem in our society. Democracies can fail. And I think that the greatest threat to democracy is misinformation because we’re going to get really good at it. When I managed YouTube, the biggest problems we had on YouTube were that people would upload false videos and people would die as a result.  And we had a no-death policy. Shocking. And it was just horrendous to try to address this. And this is before generative A.I. I don’t have a good answer.  One technical is not an answer, but one thing that seems like it could mitigate that I understand why it’s more widely used is public key authentication. That when Joe Biden speaks, why isn’t it digitally signed like SSL is? Or that celebrities or public figures or others, couldn’t they have a public key? Yeah, it’s a form of public key and then some form of certainty of knowing how the system When I send my credit card to Amazon, I know it’s Amazon. I wrote a paper and published it with Jonathan Haidt, who’s the one working on the anxiety generation stuff.  It had exactly zero impact. And he’s a very good communicator. I probably am not. So my conclusion was that the system is not organized to do what you said. You had a paper advocating what we did?  Advocating your proposal. Okay, my proposal. No, what you said. Yeah, right. And my conclusion is the CEOs in general are maximizing revenue.  To maximize revenue, you maximize engagement. To maximize engagement, you maximize outrage. The algorithms choose outrage because that generates more revenue. Therefore, there’s a bias to favor crazy stuff. And on all sides, I’m not making a partisan statement here.  That’s a problem. That’s got to get addressed in a democracy. And my solution to TikTok, we talked about this earlier privately, is there was when I was a boy, there was something called the equal time rule, because TikTok is really not social media. It’s really television, right? There’s a programmer making you the numbers by the way are 90 minutes a day, 200 TikTok videos per TikTok user in the United States.  It’s a lot, right? So and the government is not going to do the equal time rule, but it’s the right thing to do. Some form of balance that is required. All right, let’s take some more questions. Two quick questions.",1,2024-08-19 17:42:46,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwn7b0
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwna4f,Fnordinger,"One, economic impact of LMs. Slower, like, market impacts. Slower. You originally anticipated CHEG and a couple of service people. And then two, do you think academia deserves or should get AI subsidies?  Or do you think they should just partner with big players out there? I pushed really, really hard on getting data centers for universities. If I were a faculty member in the computer science department here, I would be beyond upset that I can’t build the algorithms with my graduate students that will do the kind of PhD research. And I’m forced to work with these. And the companies have not, in my view, been generous enough with respect to that.  The faculty members that I talk with, many of whom you know, spend lots of time waiting for their credits from Google Cloud. That’s terrible. This is an explosion we want America to win. We want American universities. There’s lots of reasons to think that the right thing to do is to get it to them.  So I’m working hard on that. And your first question was labor market impact. I’ll defer to the real expert here. As your amateur economist taught by Eric, I fundamentally believe that the college education high skills task will be fine because people will work with these systems. I think the systems is no different from any other technology wave.  The dangerous jobs and the jobs which require very little human judgment will get replaced. We’ve got about five minutes left. So let’s go really quick with some quick. I’ll let you pick them, Eric. Yes, ma’am.  Hi. I’m really curious about the text to action and its impact on, for example, computer science education. I’m wondering what you have thoughts on how CS education should transform to meet the age. Well, I’m assuming that computer scientists as a group in undergraduate school will always have a programmer buddy with them. So when you learn your first for loop and so forth and so on, you’ll have a tool that will be your natural partner.  And that’s how the teaching will go on. That the professor, he or she will talk about the concepts, but you’ll engage with it that way. And that’s my guess. Yes, ma’am, behind you. Yeah.  You’re talking more about the non-transformer architectures that you’re excited about. I think one that’s been talked about is like state models, but then now a longer context class. I’m more so curious what you’re seeing in this case. I don’t understand the math well enough. I’m really pleased that we have produced jobs for mathematicians because the math here is so complicated, but basically they are different ways of doing gradient descent, matrix multiply, faster and better.  And transformers, as you know, is a sort of systematic way of multiplying at the same time. That’s the way I think about it. And it’s similar to that, but different math. Let’s see, over here. Yes, sir.  Go ahead. You mentioned in your paper on natural security that you have China and the U.S. and the help of modern architectures today. The next 10 and the next cluster down are all other U.S. allies or teed up nicely through the U.S.  allies. I’m curious what your take is on those 10 and the middle that aren’t formally allies. How likely are they to get on board with securing our security deadline and what would hold them back from wanting to get on board? The most interesting country is India because the top AI people come from India to the U.S. and we should let India keep some of its top talent.  Not all of them, but some of them. And they don’t have the kind of training facilities and programs that we so richly have here. To me, India is the big swing state in that regard. China’s lost. It’s not going to come back.  They’re not going to change the regime as much as people wish them to do. Japan and Korea are clearly in our camp. Taiwan is a fantastic country whose software is terrible, so that’s not going to work. Amazing hardware. And in the rest of the world, there are not a lot of other good choices that are big.  Europe is screwed up because of Brussels. It’s not a new fact. I spent 10 years fighting them. And I worked really hard to get them to fix the EU act and they still have all the restrictions that make it very difficult to do our kind of research in Europe. My French friends have spent all their time battling Brussels and Macron, who’s a personal friend, is fighting hard for this.",1,2024-08-19 17:43:11,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwna4f
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwndhl,Fnordinger,"And so France, I think, has a chance. I don’t see Germany coming and the rest is not big enough. Go ahead. Yes, ma’am. So I learned you’re an engineer by training, like you call the compiler.  Given the capabilities that you envision these models having, should we still spend time learning to code? Because ultimately, it’s the old thing of why do you study English if you can speak English? You get better at it. You really do need to understand how these systems work, and I feel very strongly. Yes, sir.  Yeah. I’m curious if you’ve explored the distributed setting and I’m asking because, sure, like making a large cluster is difficult, but MacBooks are powerful. There’s a lot of small machines across the world. So do you think like folding at home or a similar idea works for training? It does not.  Yeah, we’ve looked very hard at this. So the way the algorithms work is you have a very large matrix and you have essentially a multiplication function. So think of it as going back and forth and back and forth. And these systems are completely limited by the speed of memory to CPU or GPU. And in fact, the next iteration of Nvidia chips has combined all those functions into one chip.  The chips are now so big that they glue them all together. And in fact, the package is so sensitive that the package is put together in a clean room as well as the chip itself. So the answer looks like supercomputers and speed of light, especially memory interconnect, really dominate it. So I think unlikely for a while. Is there a way to segment the LLM?  So Jeff Dean, last year when he spoke here, talked about having these different parts of it that you would train separately and then kind of federate. In order to do that, you’d have to have 10 million such things and then the way you would ask the questions would be too slow. He’s talking about eight or 10 or 12 supercomputers. Yeah, yeah. So not at the level of MacBooks.  Not at his level. Yeah. Let’s see, in the back. Yes, way back. So I know after GQQ was released in the New York Times to open it up for using their works for training, where do you think that’s going to go and what that means for data processing?  I used to do a lot of work on the music licensing stuff. What I learned was that in the 60s, there was a series of lawsuits that resulted in an agreement where you get a stipulated royalty whenever your song is played. Even they don’t even know who you are. It’s just paid into a bank. And my guess is it’ll be the same thing.  There’ll be lots of lawsuits and there’ll be some kind of stipulated agreement, which will just say you have to pay X percent of whatever revenue you have in order to use ASCAP BMI. ASCAP BMI. Look them up. It’s along. It will seem very old to you, but I think that’s how it will alternate.  Yes, sir. Yeah, it seems like there’s a few players that are dominating AI, right? And they’ll continue to dominate. And they seem to overlap with the large companies that all the antitrust regulation is kind of focused on. How do you see those two trends kind of...  Yeah, do you see regulators breaking up these companies and how will that affect the... Yeah. So in my career, I helped Microsoft get broken up and it wasn’t broken up. And I fought for Google to not be broken up and it’s not been broken up. So it sure looks to me like the trend is not to be broken up.  As long as the companies avoid being John D. Rockefeller the senior. And I studied this. Look it up. That’s how antitrust law came.  I don’t think the governments will act... The reason you’re seeing these large companies dominate is who has the capital to build these data centers, right? So my friend Reed and my friend Mustapha... He’s coming next week, two weeks from now. Have Reed talk to you about the decision that they made to take inflection and essentially piece part it into Microsoft.  Basically, they decided they couldn’t raise the tens of billions of dollars. Is that number public that you mentioned earlier? No. Have Reed give you the number. Maybe Reed can say it.",1,2024-08-19 17:43:41,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwndhl
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwngm7,Fnordinger,"I know you got to go. I don’t want to hold you back. I want to leave with... Shall we do one? This gentleman.  I also have a question for you. One more. Yeah, go ahead. Thank you so much. I was wondering where all of this is going to lead countries who are non-participants in development of frontier models and access to compute, for example.  The rich get richer and the poor do the best they can. They’ll have to... The fact of the matter is this is a rich country’s game, right? Huge capital, lots of technically strong people, strong government support, right? There are two examples.  There are lots of other countries that have all sorts of problems. They don’t have those resources. They’ll have to find a partner. They’ll have to join with somebody else, something like that. I want to leave it...  Because I think the last time we met you, you were at a hackathon at AGI House and I know you spend a lot of time helping young people as they create a lot of wealth, and you spoke very passionately about wanting to do that. Do you have any advice for folks here as they’re building their... They’re writing their business plans for this class or policy proposals or research proposals at this stage of the careers going forward? Well, I teach a class in the business school on this, so you should come to my class. I am struck by the speed with which you can build demonstrations of new ideas.  So, in one of the hackathons I did, the winning team, the command was, „Fly the drone between two towers,“ and it was given a virtual drone space. And it figured out how to fly the drone, what the word between meant, generated the code in Python, and flew the drone in the simulator through the tower. It would have taken a week or two from good professional programmers to do that. I’m telling you that the ability to prototype quickly... Part of the problem with being an entrepreneur is everything happens faster.  Well, now, if you can’t get your prototype built in a day using these various tools, you need to think about that, right? Because that’s who your competitor is doing. So, I guess my biggest advice is when you start thinking about a company, it’s fine to write a business plan. In fact, you should ask the computer to write your business plan for you, as long as it’s legal. No, no.  Actually, I should talk about that after you leave this. But I think it’s very important to prototype your idea using these tools as quickly as you can, because you can be sure there’s another person doing exactly that same thing in another company, in another university, in a place that you’ve never been. All right. Well, thanks very much, Aaron. Thank you all.  I’m going to rush off. Thank you. So, actually, let me pick up on that very last point, because I don’t think I talked about in the first class about using LLMs, which is welcome in this class for the assignments, but it has to get to your full disclosure. So, when you use them, whether it’s for the weekly assignments or for the final project or whatever, just like you would if you asked your friendly uncle or a classmate or anybody else to give you advice, you should do that, or if you have notes that you include in there. So, what I thought I’d do is I want to talk a little bit about AIs as a GPT and what that means in terms of business and implications.  But before we do that, I just want to see if there are any questions you want to pick up on things that Eric brought up that I’ll try and channel some of his thoughts, and we can talk about the things that came up, and then we can move on. Yeah, go ahead. One of the questions I want to ask is in relation to regulation, if the goal is to maintain supremacy, how do you create the right incentives so that everyone, allies and non-allies, are motivated to follow it? You mean among companies that are competing with each other? Companies are in countries, the U.S.  and the EU, and it doesn’t just become sort of a hamper or obstruct kind of development for the ones that choose to follow the regulations? It’s super tricky. There’s a book, Co-Opetition, that Mary Nailbough wrote about this, because there are definitely places where regulation can help companies and help an industry survive. So regulation doesn’t necessarily slow things. I mean, standards are a good example, and having that clarified can make it easier for companies to compete.  So I’ve talked to a lot of the executives of these companies, and there are places where they wish there were some common standards, and sometimes there’s a bit of a race to the bottom as well on some of the dangerous things. One of the other reasons that the folks at Google say that they didn’t move as fast is they felt like these LMs could be misused or dangerous, but their hand was sort of forced. I was talking to some folks at one of the other big companies, and they said, „We weren’t going to release this feature, but now competitors are doing it, so we’re going to have to release it as well.“ So this is where regulation, there might be some interest in coordinating on regulation, but it’s also, obviously, the more obvious thing is that it is used to hinder competition, and a lot of people, for instance, think that the reasons that some of the big companies are very opposed to some of the open source and making things more widely open source is they want to slow down competitors. So there’s both of those things going on. Yeah.  Quick question over there. I just want to follow up on a comment about, should we still learn to code? Should we still study English? Are those going to be useful? And Eric’s replied, yes, like college-educated, high-skilled jobs or tasks are still going to be safe, but everything else that’s going to require image editing might not be.",1,2024-08-19 17:44:09,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwngm7
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwnknh,Fnordinger,"That’s kind of like an interesting one. Maybe we’ll talk some more about that in a few minutes, but it is interesting to think about where the AI systems just replace what people are doing versus they complement them. And in coding right now, it appears that they’re not actually that helpful for the really best coders. They’re very helpful for moderately good coders. But if you don’t know anything at all about coding, they’re not helpful either.  So it’s kind of an inverted you. And you can see why that would be the case, that if you don’t even understand the code that they generate right now is often buggy or it isn’t exactly right. So if you can’t even interpret and understand what’s going on, you can’t use it very effectively. And for now, the very best coders, it appears that the code that is generated isn’t at that level, so you get that U shape. But that means if you don’t know any code, you do need to have some in order for it to be useful.  And I think that’s true for a lot of applications right now, that you have to have some basic understanding in order to get the most of it. I think it’s an interesting open question if that’s always going to be the case. I put up at the last class very briefly this slide that had level 0 through 5 autonomous cars. And one of the things that actually we can talk about now is I’m trying to sort through is what if you took that paradigm and you applied it to all tasks in the economy? Like how many would they go through?  So with autonomous cars, we aren’t really at level 5 very much although I don’t know how many of you guys have ridden in a Waymo, one of the Waymo cars. So that one seems pretty good, although Sebastian Thrun, who I rode in it with, says it’s just incredibly expensive right now. They probably lose $50 to $100. He doesn’t know he’s not there. He started the program, but he’s not there anymore.  But just all of the costs of running it, it’s not practical. Maybe it’ll get down the curve. Lidar will get cheaper, but we have a lot of sort of autonomous cars at level 2, 3, even 4, arguably, where humans are still involved. And you see a lot of other tasks like coding. I just talked about that.  On the other hand, chess, that slide, the slide before it, I talked about what’s sometimes called advanced chess or freestyle chess. When Gary Kasparov, after he lost to Deep Blue in 1998, ‚97, he started this set of competitions where humans and machines could work together. And for a long time, when I gave my TED talk, it was true, my TED talk in 2012, 2013, it was true at that time that a human working with a machine could beat Deep Blue or any chess computer. And so the very best chess playing entities were these combinations. That’s not true anymore.  AlphaZero and other programs like that, they would get nothing from a human contributing, just be like kind of an annoyance to the chess machine. So that went through level zero, machines not being able to do anything, through a period where they work together to a period where it’s fully autonomous in a span of 20 years or so. It would be interesting if anybody wants to work on a research project or if any of you guys have thoughts right now, what are the criteria for which kinds of tasks in the economy will be in that middle zone? Because that middle zone is kind of a nice one for us humans where the machines are helping us, but humans are still indispensable to creating value and that would be, that’s a zone where you can have higher productivity, more wealth and performance, but also more likely to have shared prosperity because labor is sort of inherently distributed, whereas technology and capital, as Eric was just saying, potentially could be very concentrated. Do you have a thought on that?  I was just going to ask kind of a related question. He was saying also that we have a 10 year like chip manufacturing. Yeah, I was surprised about that. And I think what was interesting to me as a labor economist is that it was really like a green flag I’ve seen in literature and news that, okay, if we’re on showing all of this chip manufacturing, isn’t that going to create some sort of resurgence in blue collar jobs? And I wondered if you had any thoughts about intelligent robotic models or human labor.  Well, I don’t think it’s going to be much of a, I mean, how many of you guys have visited the chip fab, anybody? You guys, some, a few of you have. How many workers were in that fab? Yeah, I mean, well, okay. So the answer is zero.  Like the reason they don’t let you, they don’t let anyone go in because we humans are too like clumsy and dirty and like, you know, we can’t, this just, so it’s all robotic. It’s sealed inside. So there is like work to, you know, bring stuff to them, et cetera. And if a robot like falls over or something goes wrong, they have to put on, you’ve probably seen these like, they look like space suits, you know, they have to go in and then they kind of maybe adjust something and then they go back out and hope they didn’t break anything. That’s, so it’s basically lights out.  Yeah, I don’t think it’s, there are some, there is some like more sophisticated labor required that I don’t think it’s like a blue collar research. In fact, one of the reasons that Apple reshored MacBook production to Texas is not because labor is so cheap in Texas or anything. It’s that they don’t actually require a whole lot of labor anymore. So it’s a pretty labor, I think. US manufacturing is surging in terms of output, but in terms of employment, it’s not really growing all that much.  Yeah. Let’s go over here. Yeah. Do you think you have an inflation point coming for agents or text action models in the next year? Oh, yeah.  No, no. Well, he said what Eric, I’m hearing similar thing. Actually, he had a really nice way of putting those three trends. I’ve heard about them all separately, but I think it was good to bring them all together. Earlier today, I was talking to Andrew Eng, and he’s like been beating this drum about agents in particular as being sort of the wave of 2024 where Andrew had a nice way of describing it that like, as you guys know, like if you have an LLM, I don’t know, write an essay or something like that, it writes it one word at a time and it just goes through in one pass and writes the essay.",1,2024-08-19 17:44:45,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwnknh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwno2n,Fnordinger,"And it’s pretty good. But imagine if you had to do that, like no backspace, no chance to make an outline first. You just kind of go through. The agents now will say, okay, first make an outline. That’s the first step you do when you write an essay.  And then, you know, fill in each paragraph, then go back and see if the flow is right. Now go back and check the voice. Is this the right level for our audience? Now, you know, and by iterating like that, you can write a much, much better essay or any kind of a task. This is a real revolution.  There’s all sorts of things you can just do much better if you do that. Then the thing about the context window is also really important. So I’m just going to quote smart people that I know. Eric Corvitz, I was on a panel with him at the GSB. Some of you may have been there.  It was last week. And he had this nice taxonomy. People were asking about fine-tuning. I think Susan was asking about fine-tuning. And he said, well, there’s really three ways that you can take a model and have it more customized.  One is you can fine-tune it, which basically like train it some more. Another is with larger and larger context windows. And the third is with RAG or techniques like that that are retrieval augmented generation where it goes and accesses external data. But these context windows seem to be like remarkably effective now. I guess, as Eric was saying, we thought it was hard.  Maybe Peter can explain. But for some reason, we’re able to make much, much bigger ones. And now as you can load a whole book or a whole set of books, you can load all sorts of information in there. And that can give you all of the context around it. So that’s a pretty big revolution.  It opens up a bunch of capabilities that we just didn’t have before, including having things much more current, as Eric was saying. Did you want to follow up on that? That’s a good question. I mean, there’s certainly a lot more capital going in, but that kind of begs the question in the comments, why is all this capital going there as opposed to somewhere else? And I think if you look at the arc of history, sometimes it looks kind of smooth.  But if you look more closely, there’s a lot of jumps. There are certain big inventions and smaller inventions. And Andrew Carparthi was saying that he was playing around with physics. And to really make progress in physics, to be a top physicist, you have to be incredibly smart, study a whole lot. And maybe if you’re lucky, you could make some small incremental contribution, and some people do.  But he says that right now in AI machine learning, we seem to be in an era where there’s just a lot of low-hanging fruit, that there have been some breakthroughs. And instead of exhausting the space, like picking all the food off of a tree, it’s more like combinatorics. In second machinery, they talk about building blocks. When you put two building blocks together, or Lego blocks, you can make more and more. Right now, we seem to be in an era where there’s just a lot of opportunity, and people are recognizing that.  And discovery, one discovery begets another discovery, begets another opportunity. And because of that, it attracts the investment. And more people are involved. And in economics, sometimes when more resources go in, you get diminishing returns, like in, I don’t know, in agriculture or in mining. Other places, there’s increasing returns.  And more engineers coming to Silicon Valley makes the existing engineers more valuable, not less valuable. So we seem to be in an era where that’s happening. And then the flywheel of the additional investment, the additional dollars for training, all of that makes them more and more powerful. I don’t know how long this will continue, but I don’t, you know, it just seems that there are some technologies that hit this really fertile period, and there’s positive feedback and some help. We seem to be in one of those right now.  So people who are trained in getting in the field are making contributions that are often quite significant in a faster time than they might have in some other fields. Encouraging all of you guys, I think are doing the right thing right now. Yeah. Let’s take a couple more questions, and then yeah. Okay, how about over here?  So not everyone can sit in a room and have all these discussions and debates around AI. And so I’d like to get your thoughts on AI literacy for non-technical stakeholders, whether they’re policy makers that have to make it in somewhat informed judgment, or the general public like, you know, using tech. How do you think about explaining technical basics versus discussing abstract implications that don’t necessarily have it right in? Well, that’s a hard one. I have to say there’s been a sea change recently in terms of how much people in Congress and elsewhere are paying more attention to this topic.  It used to be not something that they were interested in. Now everyone’s trying to understand it a little bit better. And I think that there are a lot of margins where people can make contributions. They can make contributions in the technical side. But if anything, I mean, my bet is that the business and economic side is where the bigger bottleneck is right now.",1,2024-08-19 17:45:16,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwno2n
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwnqxf,Fnordinger,"That, you know, even if, you know, if you made enormous contribution to the technology side, you still, there’s still a gap converting that into something that will change policy. So understand if you’re into political science or politician, understanding what are the implications for democracy and for misinformation and power and concentration. Those are things that are not well understood at all. I don’t know that a computer scientist is necessarily the right person to try to understand that. But understanding enough about the technology so you know what might be possible.  And then thinking through what are the dynamics like Henry Kissinger was doing with Eric Schmidt in his book. If you’re an economist thinking through the labor market implications, the implications for concentration, the implications for inequality and jobs, implications for productivity and what drives productivity. Those are things that are very ripe right now. And you could go through lots of different fields where there’s, you know, understanding well enough what the technology might be capable of. But then thinking through the implications.  That’s I think where some of the biggest payoffs are. I mean, let me give you a little bit more of a concrete example. And this is something I was going to talk about last week. Electricity was also a general purpose technology. And general purpose technologies have this characteristic that they’re part of in and of themselves.  But one of the real powers of general purpose technologies, GPTs as I was saying, is that they give complimentary, they ignite complimentary innovations. So electricity, light bulbs and computers and electric motors and electric motors give you compressors and refrigerators and air conditioning. You can just kind of have a whole set cascade of additional innovations from this one innovation. And most of the value comes from these complimentary innovations. One thing people don’t appreciate enough is that some of the most important complimentary innovations are organizational and human capital complementarities.  So with electricity, when they first introduced electricity into factories, Paul David here at Stanford studied what happened to those factories. And surprisingly, not much. The factories when they started electrifying, they were not significantly more productive than the previous factories that were powered by steam engines. He’s like, well, that’s kind of weird because this seems like a pretty important technology. Is it just a fad?  Obviously not. The factories before electricity were powered by steam engines. They typically had a big steam engine in the middle and then crankshafts and pulleys that powered all the equipment. And it was all distributed. But you tried to have it as close to the steam engine as possible because if you make the crankshaft too long, it would break the torsion.  When they introduced electricity, he found that in factory after factory, they would pull out the steam engine and they would get the biggest electric motor they could find and put it where the steam engine used to be and fire it up. But you know, it didn’t really change production a whole lot. You can see that that’s not a big deal. So then they started building entirely new factories from scratch in a new location. What did those look like?  Just like the old ones. They would take the same model. Some engineer would make a blueprint, you know, maybe take it, make a big X where the steam engine says, no, no, put electric motor here. And they’d go and build a fresh factory. Again, not a big improvement in productivity.  It took about 30 years before we started seeing a fundamentally different kind of factory where instead of having the central power source, you know, a big one in the middle, you had distributed power because electric motors, as you guys know, you know, you can make them big, you can make a medium, you can make them really, really small. You can have them all connected in different ways. So they started having each piece of equipment have a separate piece of a separate motor instead of one big one. They called it unit drive instead of group drive. I went and read the books in Baker Library at Harvard Business School from like 1914.  And it was like this whole debate about unit drive versus group drive. Well, when they started doing that, then they had a new layout of factories where it was typically on a single story where the machinery was not based on how much power it needed, but based on the on something else, the flow of materials. And you started having these assembly line systems. That led to a huge improvement in productivity, like a doubling of productivity or tripling in some cases. So the lesson is not that electricity was a fad or dud and was overhyped.  Electricity was a fundamentally valuable technology. But it wasn’t until they had that process innovation, that organizational innovation of rethinking how to do production that you got the big payoff. There’s a lot of stories like that. I only told you one of them. We don’t want that much time.  So I tell you the other ones. But in some of my books and articles, if you look at the steam engine and others, you had similar generational lags decades before people realized that this technology could allow you to do something completely different than you used to do. I think AI is a bit like that in some ways, that there’s going to be a lot of organizational innovations, going to be new business models, new ways of organizing an economy that we hadn’t thought of before. Right now, people are mostly just retrofitting. I could go through a whole other set of skill changes that are complementary.  I don’t know what they all are. You have to be creative to think about them. But that’s what the gap is. In the case of early computers, it’s literally like 10 times more investment in organizational capital and human capital, if you look at the size of the investments, to the hardware and software. So that’s very big.  That said, I’m open to adjusting my thoughts on this a bit because ChachiPT and some of the other tools, they have been adopted very quickly and they have much more quickly been able to change things, in part because you don’t need to learn Python to the same degree. You can do a lot of things just in English. And you can get a lot of value just by putting them on top of the existing organization. So some of it’s happening faster. And in some of the papers that you may have read for the readings here, you know, we had like 15, 20, 30% productivity gains pretty quickly.",1,2024-08-19 17:45:41,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwnqxf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwnsw6,Fnordinger,"But my suspicion is that it will be even bigger once people figure out these complementary innovations. And so that’s a long way of answering your question about it. It’s not just the technical skills. It’s figuring out all the other stuff, all the ways of rethinking things. So those of you who are at the business school or in economics, you know, there’s a lot of opportunity there to rethink your areas now that you’ve been given this amazing set of technologies.  Yeah, question. It seems like you’re expressing more caution than Eric was with regard to the speed of transformation. Am I correct in saying that? Well, so I would make a distinction between two things. I’ll defer to him and others on the technology side.  We’re going to hear from several other folks. And there are people who are equally optimistic as him or even more optimistic on the technology side. There’s also people who are less optimistic. But technology alone is not enough to create productivity. So you can have an amazing technology.  And then for various reasons, A, maybe people just don’t figure out an effective way to use it. Another is it may be regulatory things. I mean, some of my computer science colleagues introduced and developed better radiology systems for reading medical images. They weren’t adopted because of cultural, you know, people just didn’t want them. They didn’t want and there are safety reasons.  When I did an analysis of which tasks I could help the most and which professions were most affected, I was surprised that airline pilots was kind of near the top. But I think that a lot of people would not feel comfortable not having the pilot go down with you. So they sort of you want to have the human in there. So there are a lot of different things that might slow it down significantly. And I think that’s something we need to be conscious of.  And if we could address those bottlenecks, that would probably do more for productivity than just working on the technology alone. Yeah, question. So Eric had an interesting comment on data centers in universities. I think this is a larger point of like, and I was going to ask him why doesn’t he write a check? People are asking him that question.  Sort of like, what is the role of the university ecosystem? Obviously, there is this larger I’m sure all of the CS professors here. So I’ll take I mean, I think it’d be great if there were more funding. I mean, the federal government has something called the national AI resource that is helping a little bit, but it’s in like the millions of dollars, tens of millions of dollars, not billions of dollars, let alone hundreds of billions of dollars. Although Eric did mention to me before class that they’re working on something that could be much, much bigger.  He’s pushing for something much, much bigger. I don’t know if it’ll happen. That’s for training these really large models. I had a really interesting conversation with Jeff Hinton once. Jeff Hinton, as you know, is sort of like one of the godfathers of deep learning.  And I asked him like what kind of hardware he found most useful for doing his work. And he was sitting at his laptop and kind of just tapped his MacBook. And it just reminded me there’s a whole other set of research that maybe universities have a competitive advantage in, which is not training hundred billion dollar models, but it’s innovating new algorithms like whatever comes after Transformers and there’s a lot of other ways that people can make contributions. So maybe there’s a little bit of a divisional labor. I’m all for and support my colleagues asking for more budgets for GPUs, but that’s not always where academics can make the biggest contribution.",1,2024-08-19 17:45:58,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE#comment-liwnsw6
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3f6XM6_7pUE,liwnth7,Fnordinger,"Some of it comes from ideas and new ways of different perspective about thinking about things, new approaches. And that’s likely where we have an advantage. I had dinner with Sendham Melanathon last week. He just moved from Chicago to MIT. And he was a researcher.  We’re talking about what is the comparative advantage of universities? And he made the case, you know, patience is one of them, that there are people in universities who are working on very long term projects. You know, there’s people working on fusion. They’ve been working on fusion for a long time, not because they’re going to get, you know, a lot of money this year or 10 years from now, probably from building a fusion plant or even 20 years. I don’t know how long it is for fusion.  But, you know, it’s just something that people are willing to work on even if the timelines are a little further. It’s harder for companies to afford to have those kinds of timelines. So there’s a comparative advantage or divisional labor in terms of what universities might be able to do. We have just a couple minutes left. This is kind of fun.  So we’ll just do one or two more questions. And then I want to talk a little bit about the projects. Yeah. Go ahead. I’m Kevin.  I was wondering about the emerging capabilities of AI. It seemed that Eric was leaning more towards the architectural differences and designing better models versus the last class we talked about, Morse law instead. So I’m wondering how you sort of... Well, he said all three. So you guys remember the scaling laws?  It had like three parts to it. I think I put the scaling law that Dario and team... So there’s more compute, more data and algorithmic improvements, including more parameters. And all three of them, I think I heard Eric say all three of them were important. But not to be dismissed, this last one, like new architectures, all three of them, I think, are being important.  So I think there was another question in there, though, also. How much closer are we to like an AGI type system? So Eric doesn’t think we’re like that close to AGI type systems, although I don’t think it’s like a sharp definition. You know, in fact, that was one of the... I was going to ask him that question, but we ran out of time.  It would have been good to hear him describe it. But when I was talking to him, it’s just not that sharply defined thing. In some ways, AGI is already here. Peter Norvig wrote an article called AGI is already here. I don’t know if it’s in the reading packet.  I think if it’s not, I’ll put it in there. It’s a fun little article with Blaise Iarca. And a lot of the things that 20 years ago people would have said, this is what AGI is. That’s kind of what LLMs are doing. Not as well, maybe, but it’s sort of solving problems in a more general way.  On the other hand, there’s obviously many things they do much worse than humans currently. Ironically, physical tasks are one of the ones that humans have a comparative advantage in right now. You guys may know Moravec’s paradox. Hans Moravec pointed out that often the kinds of things that a three-year-old or a four-year-old can do, like buttoning a shirt or walking upstairs, are very hard to get a machine to be able to do. Whereas a lot of things that a lot of PhDs have trouble doing, like solving convex optimization problems, are things that machines are often quite good at.  So it’s not quite things that are easy for humans and hard for computers and other things that are hard for humans and easy for computers. They’re not like the same scale. And next week we have Mira Morati, Chief Technology Officer of OpenAI, briefly the CEO of OpenAI. So come with your questions for her. We’ll see you.

Edit: I've just had a look and noticed they're using the same code from Node on Deno for the first test case, so it could be related to the compatibility layer after all.  In the comments, someone (11 months ago?) also said:  >Time to test Deno again, they've updated the server implementation to be faster!  The author said they'll do that for their next test which will be a URL shortener.

It’s good to be skeptical about big companies and their claims, but we shouldn’t throw the baby out with the bathwater. Some of the achievements of AI are pretty undeniable and exciting.  Take a look at how AI is being used in medicine to potentially save thousands of lives ([Mayo Clinic’s AI in cardiology](https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/ai-cardiology/overview/ovc-20486648)), or how it’s helping discover new materials that are super tough and useful ([MIT's AI research](https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/mit-team-discovers-tough-and-durable-new-materials-using-ai#:~:text=An%20AI%20system%20developed%20at,used%20in%20diverse%20engineering%20applications)). And there's the breakthrough in how we do matrix multiplication, making calculations faster and more efficient ([Quanta magazine article](https://www.quantamagazine.org/new-breakthrough-brings-matrix-multiplication-closer-to-ideal-20240307/)).  These aren't just small feats; they're big deals that show AI isn't just hype. Sure, benchmarks might not always tell the whole story, and yes, there’s a lot AI can’t do—like solving cellular automita or anything computationally irreducible. But dismissing AI’s value because of some problematic practices by big companies? That might be missing the forest for the trees.  On the privacy front, you’re absolutely right to be concerned. The way some companies handle data, forcing users to train their algorithms, is a big issue. It's crucial that we demand transparency and fair practices, but once again, more about how companies handle data, not the tech.  It's easy to spot and call out the flaws—especially with big tech pushing boundaries sometimes too far—but this doesn't mean AI tech itself isn't valuable or promising.

Some sort of pareidolia effect, that makes us human attribute characteristics to these math operations.  And unfortunately, it's being used to pollute social media and the web. It's as bad at coding as it is at being a journalist, and can't really get out of the computer and go ask questions to people in the real world. But it's very good at producing human sounding filler text for propaganda purposes.  Their one true big potential is acting as natural language conversational interfaces, yet unfortunately the space is claimed by big techs trying to evolve their closed gardens. For example, Gemini on my phone requires a consent to data training to let me use it the same way as Assistant, which is very intrusive and annoying, and it's an actual step back because even if it recognises commands correctly, it doesn't act on them (ex. I need to actively start navigating toward a route by interacting with it, while Assistant just does it).  I've been working with it for those purposes, and even small LLMs are kinda good, actually, maybe better than the big ones for all intent and purposes, because they only need to match the human interaction to software interfaces.",1,2024-06-18 09:02:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1dhy8wl/agi_false_positives/#comment-l94ncv6

From what I remember in school, we've already hit what we thought AGI would be. But let's be honest, AGIs aren't as groundbreaking as we hoped. Now it feels like people are trying too hard to make it seem like some kind of magic. That part of the field is a total mess.  I get that they're supposed to mimic natural language. But we seriously need to dig deeper into what exactly these things are doing because it's not just about predicting words or whatever.  If it were that simple, understanding these systems would be a breeze. Emergence theory isn't new and it's not something that only humans can do.  Totally agree that the tech is being misused. Remember when phones first got cameras? There were all these creepy stories about women being photographed in public. Just awful.  Personally, I can't stand agentic AI—it's either a big time-waster or a huge blunder. I'm all for using tech to boost what we can do because, really, tools are only as good as the people using them.  LLMs on their own? They're like a forklift with no driver. Sure, you can set it up to run solo, but that seems like a really bad idea to me.  I think it's crucial to take a close look at what's being claimed, give it a shot ourselves, and avoid getting caught up in all the drama. The field is packed with ex-crypto guys, cult followers, and doom-sayers all shouting over each other. Makes it tough to have a real talk about what this tech can actually do.  Those who get the hang of using LLMs and carve out their own spot are going to be way ahead, in my opinion, which I accept isn't worth shit.

I assume anyone who went to university in the last couple of decades has for sure learnt about all this.  These optimisations you’re talking about are mostly baked into compilers already. The code you write in university is specifically designed to demonstrate the performance benefits or writing code that aligns with how the cpu architecture you’re using performs best with carefully crafted lab exercises that demonstrate the optimisation, and in real life code scenarios you’ll probably never get that much of an acceleration. You were also probably not using all or maybe any of the optimisations your compiler offers.   Most developers in the industry are not working on very compute heavy projects. It is mostly code that reads from the database, performs some basic transformations, interacts with a queue, … there is so much latency in all these operations that it makes mindfully writing code that takes advantage of these cpu features completely irrelevant.   For most software developers in the industry, writing clean and maintainable code is far more important than optimising for performance almost every single time. The cost you pay for compute time is far lower than developers salaries, that it makes much more sense to optimise for developer time than for compute time, unless the performance benefits really affect user experience.",6,2024-12-23 01:08:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1hkaokz/how_much_optimization_is_too_much/#comment-m3dcb3e

This means that programmers are forced to give short tight time estimates, and then live up to them no matter how bad it ends up being. any asking for extensions means that you were a bad estimator of time. padding your estimates makes you look weak compared to other programmers who didn't pad their time as much. that means code is as sloppy and haphazard and fast as possible. if companies laid off 80% of middle managers and spent that budget on more programmers and let them think and try things the code would be in much better shape, but leadership doesn't trust non-managers to not goof off.",8,2024-12-23 02:22:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1hkaokz/how_much_optimization_is_too_much/#comment-m3dn8hd

But, with respect, you’re wrong about the reason people don’t worry about it these days. Cache stuff, and the need to preserve locality of cache references, and the techniques you mention, have been around for decades. Back in the 1980s and 1990s, we wrote DSP code (for dedicated DSPs) and tight code for x86 and other instruction sets. We used assembly code and fiddled around with the order of instructions until crosseyed, or until the front office told us to ship it. We really sweated the memory-access efficiency. How else could we get stuff like video codecs to work on 66MHz (sixty six megahertz) Pentium processors?  Now the processors, register files, and memory access pathways are big enough and fast enough that it’s a rare application where it’s worth giving this stuff a second thought. Also, optimizing compilers these days are astonishingly good. In most software, you’d spend more CPU cycles debugging this low level stuff that you’d save over the lifetime of the code. Not to mention programmer labor hours. And it’s libraries furnished by the chip vendors themselves that implement the performance-critical stuff. Plus, GPUs handle a lot of the rendering, ray-tracing, inner-product grinding, modeling, and other code.  I wouldn’t say coding to make optimal use of that stuff is a lost art. But it is a rare specialty now.    As pressure increases to reduce power consumption, I suspect this skill will become more important again.

And it should not be a closed club to privileged geeks like in the 70s and 80s. We should embrace that everyone can learn to code using high level programming languages.,1,2024-04-23 09:25:18,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RhEaky14msE#comment-l0v5psj

Making allocations explicit has made a fun challenge to write zero allocation code, and the compile time capabilities are really fantastic. The reflection is also pretty good. The biggest downside so far is how unstable the language is. A lot of the features I find fascinating also tend to have a lot of discussion about major changes or outright removal, such as mixins. It’s not something I’d try to introduce into a corporate environment- Go is much better for that. But for just exploring programming it’s been really fun and has provided a new perspective.  I did a blog post about writing a CSV parser in Zig, and simply avoiding memory allocations was the biggest performance gain - way more so than SIMD stuff.

I’m tired of so many compiler incompatibilities and CMake nonsense.  For me it was a toss up between Odin or Zig to explore as well. I eventually went with Zig since I wanted to at least learn enough to replace my CMake abominations with Zig build.  With Zig I do see more of a “minimize memory allocation” mentality which is more new to me. I do C++ as a hobby instead of professionally, and most of my professional work is with languages that heavily use the heap (like Java, Clojure, and PHP). Plus, the C++ STL does a lot of memory allocations, so I thought that if the standard does it, then it must not be a big issue.

I mean, if we are all working as volunteers and cannot charge more than the cost of media + postage (the postman can be paid, but not the programmer) to distribute our software products.",1,2024-11-11 02:25:59,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVuul3zWj3g#comment-lwinaq6

I love functional programming and for mainline development it is perfectly acceptable. I just wouldn’t use it for low level details, which is where something like rust comes in. But then again, most development doesn’t require that level of performance.   Frankly, functional programming hasn’t taken off because no one wants to learn to program again. They want to use the same old c/bracket languages over and over with different keywords and pretend they learned a new language.",2,2024-11-07 19:50:29,https://youtu.be/gE6nnDsh5Ck?si=XFdkLIWYffV_FRQ1#comment-lvyb2hf

They want to use the same old c/bracket languages over and over with different keywords and pretend they learned a new language.  Part of the problem might be this, but there are plenty of others, Haskell has some of the most dogshit tooling ever invented and compiler which rivals rust in terms of the slowness of compilation, any lisp codebase is nightmare to onboard into, scheme is probably the easiest if they know the compiler being used since there is about 20 of them each with different take on the standard, by the time CL program reaches 100 lines noone will ever figure it out. Erlangs syntax makes it really hard to read. Idris is actually impossible to get to compile. F# is weird MS product with massive identity crisis.  Languages like scala, elm and elixir actually try to address these issues with varying definitions of success and see some adoption because of it, but the idea that functional programming isn’t popular solely because people don’t want to learn it is just false.  Also FP is by its very nature at odds with how computers work, computer is a state mutation machine afterall.",1,2024-11-08 05:01:42,https://youtu.be/gE6nnDsh5Ck?si=XFdkLIWYffV_FRQ1#comment-lw14nss

Take it with a grain of salt, just giving you my viewpoint :)  I’d recommend upskilling in things like software architecture and design as opposed to trying to keep up with new technologies and specific languages/franeworks. As you become more senior it’s more important to focus on the WHY as opposed to the HOW. For instance why you choose x language, database, algorithm, etc And at this stage you’ll never be able to keep up especially if you work in the JS ecosystem. Cut through all the noise and make sure that you understand how to solve real problems in more general terms. Other things like being an expert in NextJs are extremely low value, particularly as AI assisted tools get better. But if you can understand how and why nextjs works, and how you could create your own lite version is orders of magnitude more valuable. Once you understand why things are the way they are and why they work it also becomes easier to understand how new things work. Also as you become more senior you’ll just have to come to grips with the fact that unless you’re one of the lucky few you will write less code and will be in more meetings, writing more documents and spreadsheets. At least in big tech or big anything.  Financially, can’t give you much advice there. I recognise you have a family but software engineers are already some of the highest paid salaried people on earth (outside of finance). Might not be easy but I’d recommend looking at ways to lower your costs if possible. Particularly because there are tons of overpaid SWE out there and the industry is only getting tougher and salaries could continue to go down (particularly in FAANG and US tech companies). I recently interviewed someone from a massive, very well paid European mammoth of a company that made them redundant because they outsourced their entire team to cheaper countries. It’s not easy and it’s stressful but take some time to figure out the largest expenses that you can cut down on and go from there. It may mean the really difficult choice of relocating and maybe even switching jobs. It may seem extremely hard and impossible but it could literally make your life a thousand times better. Remember it’s not all about work, prioritise your family and wellbeing as much as possible.  Also you’re not a boomer if you’re in your mid thirties 😂 you’re closer to being a millennial mate!  Wish you best of luck and hope things get better!! Just remember to keep looking out for yourself and your family first. Always.

https://clojure.org/about/state#actors,ltb42bb,josevalim,"Thank you for posting this. I was going to mention Rich Hickey's comments on queues vs actors yesterday but I thought it could have been too low-level and not that interesting. His take is fair and he has spoken positively and respectfully of Erlang in the past. I will only add a couple notes:  > ""requiring 2-message conversations for the simplest data reads"" and ""Reads and writes get serialized and block each other, etc.""  The Erlang VM provides mechanisms, such as persistent terms, atomic counters, ETS tables, etc, to do direct reads without requiring two messages or blocking. The default is to communicate by message passing but there are lower level options too (in the same way immutability is the default in both Elixir and Clojure but you can opt into mutability when you need it).  > ""You can’t observe anything without its cooperation/coordination""  ""observe"" may mean different things here but I'll add that the Erlang VM comes with an incredible amount of observability. Because everything runs inside processes, I can list all processes in the system, investigate how much memory they are using, their stacktrace, message queue, system state, etc. This all happens without cooperation because it is part of the Erlang VM primitives.  > ""transparent distribution isn’t transparent and the code has to change anyway""  Of course this might happen, but there is a difference between paying to change the tires of my car vs buying a whole new car. I'd rather do small changes to the code to optimize it for distribution compared to rewriting all of my code to enable distribution.  ---  Rich also mentions in his ""Simple made easy"" talk that actors complect what is going to be done and who is going to do it, which is of course correct. Channels make perfect sense for Clojure and its design. However, the coupling of who-and-what is precisely what enables the distribution and fault-tolerance properties of actors (the latter not mentioned in the page above), which is a price I am more than happy to pay.",3,2024-10-23 07:44:11,https://clojure.org/about/state#actors#comment-ltb42bb

https://www.builder.io/blog/good-vs-bad-refactoring,lmhvc7p,Professional-Cup-487,"Most of these examples feel extremely contrived where the bigger issue doesn't have to do with the refactor itself but rather bringing in some arbitrary library, or removing some core functionality (the caching one was bad lol). Like those are obviously wrong and the biggest issue is not code refactor bits  I was looking for some useful tips for when you're refactoring in terms of restructuring code to fit new feature requests or work around changed dependencies, and how you should manage the slow morph of your cordebase as its scope grows/changes in such a way that makes sense both for incomming and existing developers of that codebase.  My idea of refactoring is taking what you already have and working it to fit around some ever changing specifications.   Imo this article seems to overly couple bringing in external tools/packages with refactoring.  Only good takeaway are  >Dont change style for the sake of changing style   Write tests before refactoring and update them as you go. This ensures you're maintaining the original functionality.",2,2024-09-10 20:32:30,https://www.builder.io/blog/good-vs-bad-refactoring#comment-lmhvc7p

It’s part of his act and his transition from Rust to Go is a great example. If you took everything he said literally and spent a ton of time learning rust cause prime says its the best thing since sliced bread, and then see he switched to Go you might be pissed and feel misled. Write code in whatever language you enjoy and that pays the bills. Example being I love Java and tons and tons of companies and technologies are built on Java, but if your opinion of the tech world was based on his takes you would not know that too be true.

The problem is that Ruby on Rails encourages a very insular way of thinking, via [The Rails Doctrine](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine).   ""The menu is omakase"" states that the Rails team will dictate which tools you can use.  Except that they completely missed the boat on front-end.  Rails became popular in a valley between when Flash died but JS hadn't matured.  It was easy for a predominantly back-end framework to claim it was full-stack because front-end tooling was virtually non-existent for a few years.  Fast forward 10+ years and Rails struggles to keep up.  Considering Hansson's temper tantrums over typing DOM nodes (which are part of the HTML standard, not a TypeScript thing), and it's easy to see why.  Rails still offers great developer experience for the back-end though.  Ruby's slow, but it's fast enough for most cases, and the Rails console and Active Record are fantastic back-end tools.

I would use Go as the basis, but I wouldn't do a class on Go.

Instead of a class on SQL, I'd teach about CAP Theorem and Relational Algebra and use real-world SQL examples to illustrate.

The fact that you want to understand what a `#include` statement does in C means you have a better understanding of what programming is that many others. Code is really just precise, comprehensive specification, and that's why a machine can parse and execute code. We could've done something similar with English, but while we can be comprehensive, we can't be as precise. I'd recommend that you learn computer architecture and, when you're done with C, assembly language. This will help you truly understand the machine that is a computer more than just thinking that the brains of the computer is in the monitor, or that ChatGPT is a real person that lives inside of a computer (you can think of how it could also be called a hoax by extrapolating from there). A good starting point for you to lay the groundwork to take other courses would be Harvard and Yale's CS50's Introduction to Computer Science, better known by its edX codename, CS50x.  u/nightonfir3 gave you some good advice, but if you don't want to use VSCode, Helix and Neovide are good alternatives. If you *have* to choose between ViM and Neovim, however, I'd recommend Neovim because it is more extensible due to its support for Lua plug-ins.  u/Philfreeze suggested to you an approach to accumulate the hands-on experience from your existing working environment, and I feel that this could work better than just forcing your way through to learn how computers work and get a job out of it. Although I don't have much of an idea if a lower workload civil engineering job would actually pay higher, I know that less time at work means you will get more time to understand this expansive realm called software engineering. Apart from CS50x, there are other CS50 courses that could be of use to you, so I suppose you can take that and then check out the other courses to see what you can do for a job. Choosing your job based on the problems you face at work could be one of the best ways for you to find the path that would be relatable to the degree you got in college.",3,2024-03-02 14:10:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1b1d896/need_some_advice_for_a_noob/#comment-kt03bjf

To me it seems like you are lost a bit, you are considering something with programming involved but thats a lot of jobs these days. From frontend designer/programers over server/backend stuff, application development, embedded, sys admin, support and so on.  Here being employed as a civil engineer might actually be another benefit. If you are willing to spend some of your own time you might be able to start automating some tiresome tasks. Maybe get to learn some more technical tools you could make easier to use with a few scripts and so on.   I personally know a middle-aged guy that started out as s civil engineer and slowly took over more and more IT tasks at his job. Now he is a sys admin for a medium sized branch of the government and he seems to enjoy it a fair bit.

I wouldn't worry too much about things like VS code doing it all for you. The syntax of programming is not the difficult part in the end. You will get really good at that by just doing it. The real thing to learn is how to make good decisions on architecture/organization of code. The way to really learn that is to solve problems and try things out (a little reading up on design patterns here and there is good too). In the end career wise I think you just need to keep learning to find what you love. As you learn how to program/try more stuff you will start to understand which things you like.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAwtrJlBVJY,kokyehn,m4stero,"I've made a summary of the key points from the gpt for you:  Josh discusses the misconception that AI, like Google Bard and ChatGPT, will soon replace programming jobs, arguing it's a minor factor in the current tech layoffs.  He suggests that the core issues behind massive layoffs in the tech industry are not directly related to AI's impact but rather deeper, systemic problems within tech companies, such as artificial company growth and hyperspecialization of roles.  Josh points out that tech companies have been overhiring, creating highly specialized yet unnecessary roles to inflate stock values, a practice he refers to as ""employee farming"" or ""invisible legal fraud.""  The layoffs are also seen as a response to economic pressures, such as preparation for a looming recession, but Josh believes this is only a small part of the problem.  He criticizes the tech industry's shift towards hyperspecialization over the past 20 years, arguing it has led to a bloated workforce with many employees performing redundant or non-essential tasks.  Josh uses the example of Elon Musk's acquisition of Twitter and subsequent layoffs as a catalyst for change, suggesting Musk prioritized efficiency by cutting down on hyper-specialized roles, leading to a leaner, more efficient operation.  He advises programmers to focus on becoming generalists with a broad understanding of computer science to remain valuable and employable, despite industry trends toward specialization.  Josh lists several major companies that have announced or executed large-scale layoffs, attributing these to overhiring and economic factors, but emphasizing the need for a return to more sustainable hiring practices and the value of generalist skills in tech.  He predicts a shift in hiring practices away from hyperspecialization, with a potential increase in demand and salaries for skilled, versatile programmers.",2,2024-02-02 13:03:38,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAwtrJlBVJY#comment-kokyehn

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gtakl6/can_anyone_suggest_good_backend_roadmap/,lxkukmw,Ninetynostalgia,I think it’s a good idea to understand how HTTP or web severs in general are implemented in Java (if that’s your language of choice) - Springboot is very heavy duty and abstracts important concepts away from you.

https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gtakl6/can_anyone_suggest_good_backend_roadmap/,lxpx2yb,adalphuns,"Yeah, I second you should learn how http works and how to build a server from scratch, for the hell of learning. Nodejs and elixir both have great tutorials on building servers from scratch. I believe Elixir land will be much less polluted with garbage influences, though.   Check out pirple.com, and their node course is amazing for learning this.  https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elixir their OTP course is packed with great knowledge on servers and more software infrastructure related content (which is a side effect of elixir/erlang). Learning about the language itself teaches you a buttload of backend concept.  I'm a nodejs developer, btw. I'm not skilled in Elixir, but I did want to get into it at some point, and I purchased that elixir course. What I learned in that course was priceless and has crossed over to my nodejs work a toonnnn.  I've also trained up devs via that pirple masterclass, and they were able to get busy right away (boot camps failed to teach them this stuff). It's probably much easier to do this course vs. Elixir, since nodejs is stupid-easy to get going.  After those basics, learning a framework like Springboot will make sense since you'll have a foundation as to what exactly it's doing. You'll hurt your learning curve if you jump into the abstraction first instead of learning from the ground up (from the server to the MVC framework).  The rest of the backend is sort of a rinse and repeat of all this. Add in databases (sql, redis, Rabbit, etc.), API calls, and auth schemas, and you have backend.",2,2024-11-18 06:31:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/theprimeagen/comments/1gtakl6/can_anyone_suggest_good_backend_roadmap/#comment-lxpx2yb
